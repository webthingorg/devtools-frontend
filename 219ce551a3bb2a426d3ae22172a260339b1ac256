(or at least gave the impression of that)\n\nCan you look at the interaction there? Here is an example issue I see:\n* Clicking on the Thumbs Up -\u003e Closing the comment dialog -\u003e Clicking on thumbs up again (to remove the rating) \u003e Clicking on thumbs up (for enabling it again)\n-\u003e The feedback form doesn\u0027t show up.",
