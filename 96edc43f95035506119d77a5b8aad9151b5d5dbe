      "message": "This looks like the wrong thing to do here. Each time we call this function, we have to make a shallow copy of the entire key-to-shortcut map, and then filter against this lambda.\n\nIs it possible to restructure this, perhaps like a tree, so that we don\u0027t need to make copies? It might be more expensive to initialize, but it should be much more performant per-keystroke.",
