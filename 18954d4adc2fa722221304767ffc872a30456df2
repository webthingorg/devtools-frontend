      "message": "Tim, could you have a look?\n\nIn particular, I do not really know what I am doing in config/gni/devtools_grd_files.gni.\n\nIt would be also great if you could share any thoughts on how to get rid of  front_end/panels/sources/SourceMapNamesResolver.ts. My plan is to move the exported symbols to source_map_scopes, but I am not quite sure if I can export them directly from there or if there needs to be some \u0027legacy\u0027 machinery (I hope not).",
