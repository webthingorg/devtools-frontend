Perhaps in some languages that would be translitered into that alphabet, spelled phonetically, rather than kept as english text. So maybe it\u0027s a better idea to put necessary info in the description.\n\ne.g.\n\nA live expression is code that the user can enter into the console and it will be pinned in the UI. Live expressions are constantly evaluated as the user interacts with the console (hence \u0027live\u0027).\n\nWDY?T",

      "message": "Hi Peter,\n\nIs good that this spawn the discussion, I was also unsure on how to proceed here. The reason why I decided to go with the lock is that I could not found examples of \"live expression\" outside of the Devtools, so I assumed this was a technical term. I think the description gives a nice middle ground and we can leave any further action to the specific implementations if needed :). Thanks for the feedback",
