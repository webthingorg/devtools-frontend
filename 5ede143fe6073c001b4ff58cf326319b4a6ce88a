(4000 - 2500) \u003d 1500, divide by 1.5 to get 1000\nCLS: (0.25 - 0.1) / 1.5 \u003d 0.1\nINP: (500 - 200) / 1.5 \u003d 200 \n\nWhat I\u0027d really want to use is the variance of the metric in the field (either per-origin or across the entire web), but if we can assume the threshold correlate with a global variance for these metrics that\u0027s similar enough.",

I will bump INP threshold I think to keep a basic guideline.\n\nI had thought about using variance per-site but we don\u0027t have that information in CrUX and it might make the comparison confusing since users wouldn\u0027t know that the criteria changes.\n\nIn a future iteration I think anchoring this to global variance across the web is a good idea.",
