      "message": "These numbers are probably fine as any others, but I attempted to provide some sort of guideline: basing it off the gap between thresholds.\n\nLCP: Let\u0027s anchor to 1000 here as you have. (4000 - 2500) \u003d 1500, divide by 1.5 to get 1000\nCLS: (0.25 - 0.1) / 1.5 \u003d 0.1\nINP: (500 - 200) / 1.5 \u003d 200 \n\nWhat I\u0027d really want to use is the variance of the metric in the field (either per-origin or across the entire web), but if we can assume the threshold correlate with a global variance for these metrics that\u0027s similar enough.",
