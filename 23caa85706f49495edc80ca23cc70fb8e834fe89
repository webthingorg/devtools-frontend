We can add compatibility helpers in the trace engine to convert from the types of one source to another.",

They can be 1 or 0 and indicate if there is line data for a given sample, i.e. if a given sample needs to be included to calculate the line level execution time data, which we show in the sources panel after recording a profile.\n\n2. The CDP profile doesn\u0027t have the `lines` property AFAIK, instead the line level execution time is calculated using the \"positionTicks\" property of nodes in CDP profiles (which isn\u0027t available in trace profiles, I don\u0027t know why).\n\nI\u0027ll add these comments to the code.",
