So, I thought we can write tests for different panels and assert what they log on reloads.\n\nWe can have these tests in a snapshot fashion and one can update relevant test if the VE logging situation for that case is changed.\n\nI believe any failure in the assertions below would be annoying for us since:\n* the failure won\u0027t give enough context (i.e. a test name that shows what it tests specifically, failure message that shows exactly what I need to change).\n* the failure won\u0027t be directly related to the feature I\u0027m working on.

      "message": "1) Reload is only beginning. I plan to add VE assertions to most of the e2e test helpers. For instance `navigateToConsoleTab` will expect a click on the tab header followed by he impressions for the console panel.\n2) I put quite some effort in making the failure message easy to understand, see e.g. https://ci.chromium.org/ui/labs/p/devtools-frontend/inv/build-8744683876165125409/test/e2e%2Femulation%2Fcustom-devices_test.ts%3A%20Custom%20devices%2F%22before%20each%22%20hook%20for%20%22can%20add%20and%20then%20edit%20a%20custom%20device%20with%20UA-CH%20emulation%22/variant/e3b0c44298fc1c14?resultIndex\u003d0\n3) This is why I am adding these to the e2e tests, not unit tests. We should not be writing e2e tests to test a tiny aspect of a feature, but to test it end-to-end, which IMO includes logging. Your example with jslogContext of a button in Animations seems to be WAI to me.\n\nAdding Simon for a second opinion.",
