      "message": "Hi Simon and Benedikt,\n\nThis is the first part (1/2)for the sourcemap server implementation, the expected user workflow is: \nto register a plugin the developer will call `registerSourceMapServerPlugin`. This function requires two parameters two be passed:\n\n1. An instance of `SourceMapServerExtensionPlugin`\n  1.1 This instance needs to implement the `loadSourceMap(sourceMapServerRequest)` method which returns the SourceMap for the passed `sourceMapServerRequest`\n2. A name for the plugin\n\nFull details can be found in the associated proposal here:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1x9_MTMVr213ApruMK6ryc4JpPHahvOBlExP6sHkMv8Y/edit?pli\u003d1\n\nOnce this goes in, my plan is to start working on the Debugger SDK to wire the API behavior to the sourcemap resolution. (that should be part 2/2)",
