I was not sure how to make the strings shorter, so left them as is for now. \nThis is how it looks like now: https://screenshot.googleplex.com/8B2mMPLBbjAqypV.png\n\n(Did I insert too many blank lines, or is this how they are supposed to be styled?)\n\nAnother question: The current strings (\"Feature preventing bfcache...\" and \"The page was not cached because...\") were suggested by the UX team.\nIs there any process involved in changing the strings, or is the code review +1 fine?",
