I would think we could do this via some CSS to lay out the page as we\u0027d like.\n\nI used split view mostly because I wanted to mirror how other DT panels handle the sidebar/main content pattern, but the resizability doesn\u0027t hurt IMO. That being said, resizability isn\u0027t in our mocks so I\u0027m not committed to it.\n\n\u003e Do we expect or want to allow users to resize it? I\u0027m not sure what the explicit split view gives us here that we can\u0027t achieve just with some CSS which would simplify the JS and the components slightly. wdyt?\n\nI don\u0027t see why implementing a new sidebar solution would simplify the code. For example, the existing split view component automatically moves the sidebar to the bottom for narrow viewports (a feature that we do want according to the mocks).",
