      "message": "This is why I\u0027m observing the issue. Calling \u003ccheckbox\u003e.click(), instead of synchronously invoking the handler, is causing focus to change to the checkbox element itself. Although `this.focus()` is subsequently called on the next line, the call to `click()` causes the `blur` event to fire, which removes the attribute `data-keyboard-focus\u003d\"true\"`.\n\nInstead of going through the checkbox click handler, you should just call `this._checkboxClicked(item);` here.",
