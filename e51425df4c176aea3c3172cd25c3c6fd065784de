      "message": "adding `await click(\u0027[aria-label\u003d\"Search next\"]\u0027);` before this and changing the assertion to \u0027Window\u0027 makes the flake go away. However this significantly changes the scenario, is it a bug that the `retainerClassName` does not have `\u0027Detached Window\u0027` on the first result? and is it also a bug that sometimes all the results have \u0027Window\u0027 instead of `\u0027Detached Window\u0027`?",
