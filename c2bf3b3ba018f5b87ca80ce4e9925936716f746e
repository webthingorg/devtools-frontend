      "message": "I\u0027d imagine so, indeed. But let\u0027s double check with Peter and Josephine.\nUsing this default color was introduced in a previous CL: https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/devtools/devtools-frontend/+/2303879\nI\u0027m only now realizing that I didn\u0027t include you on that CL. Sorry about that. It was a really small cosmetic change that Peter approved. You can find the context in the commit message over there.\nSo, I think we\u0027re probably safe for now with this very subtle gray default color, but as we start allowing multiple grids, we\u0027ll need to think again about this. I can see 2 options: introducing another option to define the color for extended lines, or using the grid line color and making it a bit more transparent.",
