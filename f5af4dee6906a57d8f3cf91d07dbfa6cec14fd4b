      "message": "Yes, whenever there are nested swatches we\u0027ll need to hook up events to propagate updates. Alternatively, we could reparse and rerender values whenever we apply style edits, but that feels a little bit brittle and costly.\n\nNote that that\u0027s not new, we just never had the ability to have that sort of nesting in general. Some cases, like color-mix, manually implement nesting and also propagate update events.",
