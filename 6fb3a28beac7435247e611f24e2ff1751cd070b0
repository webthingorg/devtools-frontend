      "message": "Thanks for the review! This came up during the branch review with Peter (the second last one). The previous icon was a document icon, which doesn\u0027t really reflect what we\u0027re doing under \u0027Profiles\u0027. Under \u0027Profiles\u0027 you can select which kind of snapshot/dump you want to generate, so the tune button fits a bit better to what this is about ðŸ˜Š.",
