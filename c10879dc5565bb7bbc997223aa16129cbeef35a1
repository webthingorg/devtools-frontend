      "message": "Hi all, I took a brief look at it and have some feedback/thoughts. The feedback is very all over the place, but it\u0027s hard to look at a specific, small UI item from a UX perspective since the problems usually originate on a higher level.\n\n**Checkbox for filtering**\n\n- We don’t use this pattern anywhere in DevTools, we might reconsider adding it.\n\n- I think the general issue here is that it’s not clear that the item at the top controls the item at the bottom. However, we use this select/filter pattern already in a lot of pages on the Application panel.\n\n-  Let’s take UI inspiration from other panels, for example Reporting API (see [reporting-api-example.png](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id\u003d1384419#c67) or the Cookies page in the Application panel. I think this UI works pretty intuitively there so it should also work for our problem.\n\nI think there is another, more high-level solution:\n\n**Information hierarchy of spec rules**\n\n- Right now, we have a double drill down on the right side: first select speculation rule, then click on filtered item.\n\n-  Consider moving the top hierarchy (the speculation rules) to the sidebar, similar to what cookies is doing (see [move-to-sidebar.png](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id\u003d1384419#c67)).\n\n- This way you make the hierarchy more obvious and the spec rules also look more selectable. You completely avoid the problem with selecting items from the table and filtering them below.\n\n- The top menu item `Prefetch and Prerender` can show an overview of all rules plus the validity, while the individual speculation rule items show the individual prefetched items.\n\n**Menu item and string**\n\n- Let’s not create a whole new section for just one item, better put it under “Background Services” ([sidebar-location.png](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id\u003d1384419#c67)).\n\n- Right now the menu item is called `Prefetching \u0026 Prerendering`.\n\n- Let’s replace the `\u0026` with `and` or `/`, since the ampersand `\u0026` is reserved for brand names.\n\n- Can we shorten it further? \u2028`Prefetch and Prerender` maybe.\n\nHope this helps to make a decision on how to move forward.",

      "message": "Hey Peter, thanks for your help here! Ken asked me to add my thoughts.\n\nFirst, we definitely agree on the menu item and string. We\u0027ll fix that.\n\nRegarding the filtering and the overall design, you\u0027re totally right that we could do better here. I\u0027d love to have that discussion in more detail and get a bit more of your time. (E.g., how do we derive the labels you suggest \"Speculation rules 1\" \"Speculation rules 2\"? How does this compare to cookies or the network panel? Etc.) I plan to start a thread on that shortly.\n\nBut, in the shorter-term, I\u0027m wondering if we can move forward with this checkbox approach as a stopgap. Both us engineers working with the DevTools, and the partners we have alpha-testing it, often get ourselves stuck with \"why are there no candidates showing?\" or \"how do I get back to the view where all the potential candidates are showing?\" So I think we need to do something as soon as we can to avoid this common failure mode. I think the checkbox is the best such solution for now. The only other quick-fix ideas I have, before a larger redesign, are:\n\n- Never do any filtering, and hope that developers don\u0027t miss this functionality too much.\n- Use a \"clear filter\" button somewhere, instead of a checkbox.\n\nWhat do you think?",

      "message": "Hi Domenic, I just saw the email thread, thank you for opening it! I see that I went a bit overboard before, so let\u0027s quickly unblock you and continue the discussion in the email thread.\n\nConsider this alternative to the \"Filter by selected rule set\" checkbox: [show-all.png](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id\u003d1384419#c71). It avoids adding a \"mode\" to the panel. The \"1 / 5 resources\" pattern is already used in the network panel and hints towards that there are more resources hidden. \"Resources\" might be the wrong word here, maybe request, but that\u0027s up to you.\n\nIf you don\u0027t like this option, go ahead with the checkbox.\n\nHope this helps!",
