      "message": "Something to consider for the future, should we use different default colors for the distributed and gap space. I can imagine a case where a user is moving back and forth between properties, and the highlight appears in a slightly different spot but with the same color and might be confusing? Then again, that might not happen between these two types of gaps, so feel free to ignore if that scenario is not possible",

      "message": "Hm, that could indeed be confusing, if you had a, say, 10px gap but there was enough space on the line to distribute the items with justify-content in a way that the gap between items ended up being 12px wide. So, 10px would be due to the gap property, and 2px to the justify-content property.\nIn that case, hovering over those 2 properties in the Styles pane would result in almost the same thing, and it\u0027d be really hard to spot the difference.\nSo that\u0027s a good point, I\u0027m inclined to wait until we start working on v2 though to address this. In v2 we\u0027re planning on making this feature more discoverable, so it\u0027d be a good time to revisit the colors then too.",
