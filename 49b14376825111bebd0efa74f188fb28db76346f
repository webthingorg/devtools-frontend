      "message": "I would defer to Peter to see if this is a good idea. I think allowing more developers to discover the hover-ability is generally a good direction, but it\u0027s the same argument with badges and DOM tree warnings: if we have quite a few variables in the Styles pane, moving your mouse through the pane would trigger many unnecessary popups and therefore visual noises.\n\nI think a compromise in the middle would be to trigger the popup when the mouse stays for \u003eXms, e.g. \u003e500ms? This way we could avoid unintended mousemoves triggering popups.\n\nI also did a bit searching around, and found these two links explaining the delay of ARIA titles:\nhttps://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/62721/why-does-the-title-attribute-have-a-delay\nhttps://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/358/how-long-should-the-delay-be-before-a-tooltip-pops-up\n\nI think they have a good point. But again, I\u0027m not an UX expert, so I\u0027ll defer to Peter ðŸ˜Š",
