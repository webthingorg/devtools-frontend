      "message": "@Paul I have taken this CL, added tests, pulled out the saving logic into its own module, and integrated it back into the panel\u0027s save file code.\n\nI have removed the startTime metadata change - we should do that as a separate CL and update the type defs correctly. I have logged crbug.com/1433600 to track that work in our backlog.\n\nPTAL at my changes and check you are happy.\n\nGiven that both Paul and I have changed this code, @andoli please could you also take a look as a neutral reviewer? Thanks!",
