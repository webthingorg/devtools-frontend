      "message": "Thanks! It\u0027s a bit hard to follow what is refactoring and what is new. Would it be possible to split the CL up into a couple of smaller CLs? That would be easier for me to review ðŸ˜Š (e.g. split out the base class in one CL, then extend it to SourceFrameIssuesManager if that is possible)\n\nSecond question: It\u0027s a bit odd that SourceFrameIssueManager inherits from something called PresentationConsoleMessageBase. Could we solve this via composition instead? So both `PresentationSourceFrameMessageHelper` and `SourceFrameIssuesManager` create an instance of this new Base thing themselves and stash it in some property, instead of solving this via inheritence? wdyt?",
