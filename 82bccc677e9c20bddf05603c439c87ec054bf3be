When I look at the failure here https://ci.chromium.org/ui/p/devtools-frontend/builders/ci/Stand-alone%20Mac/9687/overview the timeout still says 10s instead of 20s. I believe this is because we are trying to set the timeout in the test itself, when this code should be moved to the body of the `describe` block.",
