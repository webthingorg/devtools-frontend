      "message": "I think what we can do here is extend HTMLElementEventMap straight up and then not have to re-implement the addEventListener (else we\u0027ll have to do that all the time).\n\nSo more like it\u0027s done here:\n\nhttps://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:third_party/devtools-frontend/src/front_end/panels/elements/components/StylePropertyEditor.ts;l\u003d33?q\u003dStylePropertyEditor.ts\u0026ss\u003dchromium\n\nI think you lose a small amount of type-safety as theoretically anyone could add a `formatchanged` event listener to not a color swatch component, but I think that\u0027s OK to avoid the admin of re-typing addEventListener for every single component. WDYT?\n\nBTW, this CL did also inspire me to log a bug and update the docs/etc with how we want to type custom events, so thanks. Tracking that work here: https://crbug.com/1229172",
