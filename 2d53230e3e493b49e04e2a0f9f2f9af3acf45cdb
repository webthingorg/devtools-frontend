      "message": "Why is this function named \"copy PATH handler\"? Doesn\u0027t it copy the property value?\n\nAlso, I\u0027m not sure why we\u0027re using `bind` here. It seems that this can just be written:\n\n    const copyPathHandler \u003d () \u003d\u003e {\n      Host.InspectorFrontendHost.InspectorFrontendHostInstance.copyText(propertyValue);\n    };\n\n`bind` was common in the ES5 days but we should try to avoid creating new bound functions, and since we\u0027re not writing code that is in line with other cases, i.e., we\u0027re not adding a new context menu item among many existing context menu items, we should just use an arrow.",
