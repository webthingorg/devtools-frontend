I don\u0027t particularly like the idea of adding something to this library that is specific for one use case...\n\nWill have a chat with Phil to see what he thinks...",

      "message": "\u003e Our use case feels a bit more legitimate, though concerns still remain about re-reporting, or missing metric updates.\n\nThe kill switch is permanent in this CL. When we re-enable the live metrics we boot up an entirely new isolated execution context and pull metric numbers from PO buffers. There\u0027s still the risk of missing stuff, but I think we need to accept that if we want to keep the timeline clean.\n\n\u003e Our use case is also a bit more niche. I don\u0027t particularly like the idea of adding something to this library that is specific for one use case...\n\nYeah, I hacked in a kill switch here so we don\u0027t need to update wv.js just for our use case. IMO this should at least be a temporary solution while we hash out a possible update to wv.js.",
