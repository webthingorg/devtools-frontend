      "message": "Hmmmm... not loving it.\n\nI think if we really want to do this we should raise a request at https://github.com/GoogleChrome/web-vitals/issues to ask for a kill switch.\n\nNote that this was discussed before:\nhttps://github.com/GoogleChrome/web-vitals/issues/357\nBut we felt there wasn\u0027t the right motivation there.\n\nOur use case feels a bit more legitimate, though concerns still remain about re-reporting, or missing metric updates.\n\nOur use case is also a bit more niche. I don\u0027t particularly like the idea of adding something to this library that is specific for one use case...\n\nWill have a chat with Phil to see what he thinks...",
