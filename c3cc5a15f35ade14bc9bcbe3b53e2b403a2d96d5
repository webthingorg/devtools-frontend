The thing you\u0027re announcing to the screenreader is that \"My group selected\" -- for a real given group -- but that group isn\u0027t selectable (we know this from line 470, `if (!groups[groupIndex].selectable)` condition). \n\nAt the very least you need to indicate that \"no group selected\" or something to that effect. But `groupIndex` isn\u0027t mutated by the call to `this._deselectAllGroups()`.",
