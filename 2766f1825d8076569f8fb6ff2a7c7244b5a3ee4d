      "message": "Good catch :) I always thought they were being filtered out (per my previous comment) but turns out they were being missed when a new view was added, the new patch should cover for this now, thanks for the feedback. I still think that we should exclude the extension (At least for now) from being moved as otherwise:\n1. This will allow to have 2+ panels from the same extension on view at the same time, which is a change of paradigm from today\u0027s behavior  and should be accounted for by the extension developer\n2. The way we move panels today, \"closes\" the panel and opens a new one on the drawer, some extensions can be broken by this behavior as they are subscribed to specific events from the Devtools extension API (e.g onShow)\n\nReact Developer tools is a good example of this:\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/blob/d6dcad6a8beaeec0513a9851d1e0fe1181932360/packages/react-devtools-extensions/src/main/index.js#L390\n\nThoughts?",
