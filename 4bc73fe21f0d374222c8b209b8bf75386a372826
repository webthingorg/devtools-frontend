      "message": "Hmmm, I think maybe we shouldn\u0027t be calling into the AccessibilityModel every time the tree is toggled.\n\nEg, imagine if a user is toggling between the two without any changes in the DOM occurring, nothing in the accessibility tree will have changed but we will continue to be serializing the tree into devtools every time the accessibility tree is toggled.\n\nThis does mean the tree will get \u0027stale\u0027, however. I think this is a section we are still trying to figure out - one idea was to tie the accessibility tree to the DOM tree, something like: https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/master:third_party/devtools-frontend/src/front_end/elements/ElementsTreeOutline.js;l\u003d1136?q\u003dElementsTreeOutline\n\nThat doesn\u0027t need to go into this patch, but it might be worth moving this refreshAccessibilityTree call into setNode()? It seems like we are relying on the DOMNode to be set before we can get the accessibility tree anyway.",
