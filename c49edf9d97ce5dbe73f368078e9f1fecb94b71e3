      "message": "This is a follow-up from the earlier change https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/devtools/devtools-frontend/+/3502175 showing highlight pseudos in the styles pane.\n\nNote, the http/tests/devtools/elements/styles-2/pseudo-elements.js failure is expected. Highlight selectors are no longer grayed-out since they are now correctly calculated as matching with this change. To land this, I\u0027m separately disabling that test in https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/3584106 and will re-enable it with the updated baseline afterwards.\n\nPTAL, thanks!",
