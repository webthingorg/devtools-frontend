      "message": "Jack, I would like the inner component (PermissionsPolicySection) to keep its state (showPermissionsDisallowedDetails flag) when the user clicks elsewhere and then comes back to this FrameDetailsView. Is there a way to make this happen without explicitly remembering that state in the outer component (FrameDetailsView)?\n\nI added `console.log`s for debugging and when coming back to a previously expanded PermissionsPolicySection I see:\n```\nPermissionsPolicySection connectedCallback true\nsetting data for FrameDetailsReportView; has policies:  true\nPermissionsPolicySection disconnectedCallback true\nFrameDetailsView until directive then\nPermissionsPolicySection connectedCallback false\n```\nI interpret this as PermissionsPolicySection is first rendered with the correct state, but it loses is once the `until`-directive kicks in (even though the data is not being fetched again).\n\nAnd maybe more generally, if we need to fetch data to render a component, should this happen within the component (so that the logic for fetching and rendering are close together) or in a parent (so that the component stays dumb and its only concern is rendering)?",

      "message": "Typically if you need some state to persist across multiple (re)renders of a component, during which time that component might be removed from the DOM and re-added in the future, you need to lift that state up into a parent component, so that\u0027s what I\u0027d recommend.\n\nI\u0027d keep fetching data closest to the component that needs it - so if data is only needed by component X, I\u0027d expect it to be fetched in component X. But if you need to do a bunch of processing to that data, or it\u0027s needed across components X, Y and Z, I\u0027d expect that fetching and processing to be done outside of the component and passed into the component as data.",
