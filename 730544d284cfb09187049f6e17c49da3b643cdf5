      "message": "Code lgtm. One follow up question:\n\nOn the edge case, we put alot of effort into calculating if a container overlay is transparent. Are there practical cases where someone would pass a transparent overlay config and not just leave it empty? I\u0027d kind of expect the inspector_overlay to not have to perform checks for transparency, just checks if it exists.",

      "message": "That\u0027s an excellent point. With the way devtools sends requests to the overlay domain right now, I think you are right, we probably could make this check simpler.\n\nI guess I was thinking about it from the backend\u0027s perspective, making sure it would work with whatever CDP clients throw at it. That being said, it would be very weird for a CDP client to send both the flex container and flex item highlight configs but make the container config transparent.",
