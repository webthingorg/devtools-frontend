We are launching the new performance panel landing page which makes heavy use of isolated execution contexts, so the problem may start to become more visible if it isn\u0027t addressed.\n\nPTAL but feel free to block if there is something wrong with my approach.",

It would be great to get an overview of what use cases this supports and I also wonder if the order in which execution contexts were received would affect the display name (perhaps we could normalize the context list).",
