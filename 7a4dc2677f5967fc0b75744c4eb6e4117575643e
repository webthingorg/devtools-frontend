      "message": "Looks all good from my side ðŸ˜Š The only Inkscape magic necessary is to place the icons correctly and snap them to full pixels. Unfortunately this has to be done manually. I usually export icons with a grey square background which fits perfectly in the iconsprite, position it, and delete the background again.\n\nIf Inkscape breaks something in the Iconsprite (forgot to run python script etc), all icons will turn into garbage in DevTools. It\u0027s immediately visible.",
