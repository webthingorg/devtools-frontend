      "message": "Hi Stephen,\n\nThanks so much for sending over this CL! ðŸ˜Š\n\nIt looks great, but please could you add a unit test for this change? You should be able to add a CSSFormatter_test.ts alongside JavaScriptFormatter_test.ts in test/unittests/front_end/formatter_worker and assert that it behaves as intended. \n\nIf you have any questions please do let me know, and thank you again.\n\nPaul",

Easy to miss that one!\n\nAlso since this is your first CL you\u0027ll need to add yourself to the AUTHORS file in the root, and sign the CLA if you haven\u0027t already: https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/contributing.md#legal-stuff\n\nActually, it\u0027s probably worth having a read of that document in any case, it has a lot of useful info in it.",
