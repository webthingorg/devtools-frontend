There\u0027s always just one that is selected, but could it be that we\u0027re getting to this point even after having pressed arrow right twice, since the UI hasn\u0027t updated yet?

      "message": "Sorry for being unclear! \n\nIt is testing what it should in the sense that there\u0027s an assert in line 21 which is correct. However, my concern is that this test may still be flaky, because we *might* not wait for the correct update. \n\nI.e. if we have \n`const expandedActivities[\u0027a\u0027,\u0027b\u0027]`, in the first iteration we\u0027ll wait for one to be selected (which is \u0027a\u0027). Afterwards we expand the tree and wait for the selector that picks the current selected tree element. Depending on whether or not the UI had time to update for \u0027b\u0027 to be the selected element, we might just see \u0027a\u0027 again instead of \u0027b\u0027.",

      "message": "Ah, thanks for explaining. I had a similar problem where we needed to wait for expansion of a data grid tree element, although in our case there is logic in devtools that will do the expanding for us.
