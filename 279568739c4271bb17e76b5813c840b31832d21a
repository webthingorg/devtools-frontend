      "message": "getRadiansFromAngle -\u003e getAngleFromRadians seems a bit confusing to me. Perhaps:\n\n```\nconst oldUnit \u003d this.unit;\nthis.unit \u003d newUnit;\nthis.updateAngle(convertAngle(this.angle, oldUnit, newUnit));\n```\n\nAlso, it looks like angle and its unit are tightly connected. Perhaps it\u0027s worth making a separate Angle type which would hold the number and the unit?",
