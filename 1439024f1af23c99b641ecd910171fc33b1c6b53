      "message": "Note: I want to drop this requirement in a later CL (we should treat each target similarly) and remove the `unshift` operation to add the primary uiSourceCode. However, this can lead to behavior in which `setBreakpoint` doesn\u0027t return any breakpoint at the moment (if the uiSourceCode is no longer valid/part of a project), and I think it\u0027s good to have a separate discussion on that.",
