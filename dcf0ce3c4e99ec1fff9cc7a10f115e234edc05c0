      "message": "Based on https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#include I think this is not the configuration option we are looking for. `include` is used to define a subset of sources. However, since we specify `files` in our TSConfig, we already instruct TypeScript to only build that subset.\n\nInstead, I would prefer to not change `ts_library` for this at all. Thinking about it again, my previous comment about not including `protocol.js` in our GRD file doesn\u0027t really make sense. In all configurations, we are now treating the file as an input file. I would have liked to have an option to mark the file as type-checking-only (e.g. what `.d.ts` does), but I don\u0027t think we can do so.\n\nTherefore, I would propose to revert these changes to the previous solution and include `protocol.js` in the GRD variable. I think that is better than updating `ts_library` here.",
