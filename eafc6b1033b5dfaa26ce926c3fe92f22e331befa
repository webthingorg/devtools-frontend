      "message": "Drive-by comment: Would it be possible to not export {instance} but just static methods or even standalone functions that are just thin wrappers to get the FrameManager instance and forward the call? This would have several advantages:\n\n1) Nobody accidentally creates a FrameManager instance\n2) Call sites become easier to read. In this case it would be:\n BrowserSDK.FrameManager.getFrame(...)\n\nFood for thought :)",

      "message": "It would be possible, but it would make it harder to test, because this cements in that FrameManager is a singleton.\n\nI like designs better that don\u0027t force the singleton nature of a class too violently, but make it clear from the interface that there is single instance that should be used.\n\nIf the instance() repeats itself too often, one can always assign to a variable.\n\nI don\u0027t see the point about accidentally creating a frame manager?",
