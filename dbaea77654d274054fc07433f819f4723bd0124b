This is the issue for private network requests from secure contexts: They will require a preflight request at some point in the future.\n\nEiji: Please take a look at the wording in front_end/models/issues_manager/descriptions/corsInsecurePrivateNetworkPreflight.md\n\nLutz: Please figure out the time-frame for the deprecation. My current assumption is that we want to show this issue starting in M92, but we can add a flag in the back-end if we want to delay further.",

      "message": "We don\u0027t have a firm date for the preflight launch to announce, and the code to perform the preflights is not yet implemented, so I think we should not show this message just yet. Happy to see this CL land behind a flag we can turn on later once things are ready, if that\u0027s possible?\n\nOnce we have the CORS code in place + API owners preliminary approval to show a deprecation message (much like we did for the secure context restriction), we can turn this on and fix the date strings?",
