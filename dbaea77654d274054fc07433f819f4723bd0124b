This is the issue for private network requests from secure contexts: They will require a preflight request at some point in the future.\n\nEiji: Please take a look at the wording in front_end/models/issues_manager/descriptions/corsInsecurePrivateNetworkPreflight.md\n\nLutz: Please figure out the time-frame for the deprecation. My current assumption is that we want to show this issue starting in M92, but we can add a flag in the back-end if we want to delay further.",
