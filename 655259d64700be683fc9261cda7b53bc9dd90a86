      "message": "In Patchset 1, the new algorithm takes 10x the time as compared to the old algorithm to run on a heap snapshot of about:blank (~40k nodes; ~200ms vs ~20ms). Turned out that the majority of time was spent in creating the bit vectors, hence in Patchset 2 I used a regular Set for `bucket` instead. This reduced the time to ~20ms so the two algorithms are now comparable for small heap snapshots with \u003c50k nodes.\n\nI\u0027m getting a stack overflow error due to the recursive DFS on larger heap snapshots, so I\u0027ll next update it to use an iterative approach instead and then measure the performance metrics.",
