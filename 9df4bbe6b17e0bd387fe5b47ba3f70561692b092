      "message": "I\u0027m a bit reluctant to add unit tests for testing the interaction or rendering. Do you have a suggestion on which tests we can write here?\n\nI feel like only these cases make sense for unit tests:\n* AnimationTimingModel is able to handle both `cubic-bezier()` and linear() functions\n* AnimationTimingUI is able to render both `cubic-bezier()` and `linear()` functions visually (without asserting on how it looks, saying that it renders \"linear-container\" or \"cubic-bezier-container\" depending on the case)\n\nWDYT?",
