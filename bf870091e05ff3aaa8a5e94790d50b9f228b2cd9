      "message": "to check my understanding, this test effectively checks that this code runs without errors?\n\nI generally prefer a test to have an explicit assertion rather than treat the absence of errors as a pass but I understand in this case this could be tricky. But I worry that this relies on the unhandled rejection listener and if that were to be removed this test would never fail, I think?\n\nNot sure if there\u0027s some way to have an explicit assertion in this test?",
