      "message": "Hi Tim and Peter,\n\nThanks for the feedback. I have a question (to avoid hitting the same issue with i18n library) from the `third_party` point of view, is there a difference between this code and a script contributed to DT infrastucture? I was under the impression that third_party approval was for code that was included as part of the DT `binaries`. Do we also need approval for infrastucture scripts?",
