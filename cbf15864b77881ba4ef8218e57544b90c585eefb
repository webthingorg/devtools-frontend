      "message": "I vaguely remember that there was some unexpected shared state with the wrapping we\u0027re doing here. I believe node_ops is shared across all nodes and not necessarily just the lazy loaded ones. That\u0027s why we\u0027re doing the `oldget !\u003d\u003d wrapper` check below. pessimistically rethrowing errors as EEXIST wasn\u0027t a problem before, but the reporting might be. Let\u0027s double check the FS implementation to understand what we\u0027re really doing here, maybe we need some additional checks in place that we\u0027re reporting the right stuff.",
