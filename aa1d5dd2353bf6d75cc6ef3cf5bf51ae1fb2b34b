      "message": "Hi Jaro,\n\nI\u0027ve made the changes that we discussed on this CL:\n\nI\u0027ve removed the sourceMappings. Since they are no longer needed:\n1. ..I\u0027ve removed the definition of `uiSourceCodesForScript` in the `DebuggerSourceMapping` interface\n2. ..`CompilerScriptMapping` no longer needs to implement that method\n3. ..the original tests for persistency that were using them for creating a mapping no longer work. So I\u0027m removing both here, and have follow up CLs (https://crrev.com/c/4154500, https://crrev.com/c/4154498) that convert them\n\nPlease take another look!",
