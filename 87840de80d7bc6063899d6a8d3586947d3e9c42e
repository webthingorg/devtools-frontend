      "message": "Good question. I don\u0027t think we can do that, since `gclient sync` shouldn\u0027t typically error. Here, we assume that the engineer knows more about the value and maybe deliberately wants to use a different value. Moreover, I think we should be conservative with adding settings here, to avoid discussions regarding styles.\n\nIn this case, the ESLint runtime is required to be equivalent to the presubmit runtime, so it will be helpful. In other cases, we should evaluate whether it is a stylistic change or if it will be required to make VS Code produce the correct output. E.g. any setting added here should ideally have only one correct value.\n\nWDYT?",
