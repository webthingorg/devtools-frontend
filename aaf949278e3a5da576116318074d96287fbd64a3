      "message": "We haven\u0027t tried it in the eval tool; I\u0027m not sure we have examples where it would make a difference and we\u0027d need to copy the formatter code. I can see what difference it makes in terms of what code gets sent to AIDA, but I don\u0027t know if it is affecting results; I have never reproduced the issue where it alerts the user to a syntax error that is just a truncation artifact, but that is what it\u0027s supposed to fix.",
