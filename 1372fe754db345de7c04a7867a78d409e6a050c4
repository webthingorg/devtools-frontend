      "message": "Turns out this was the reason the i18n layout test was timing out. two concerns...\n\n1. Why didn\u0027t typescript catch this?\n2. Why can\u0027t the layout test give a better error message / partial output?\n\nThe test is still failing now, but it fails because fetching the remote locale file times out in CI, so the test expectations differ.\n\nThis test worked when initially landed b/c it used a relative path to grab the locale file, which happens to exist in CI. I\u0027d like to use that as a fallback here, so this test goes back to passing. I understand there\u0027s a preference to have no branching based on release/local: I\u0027d like to hear your alternatives. I think you might suggest an e2e test (not familiar with them): perhaps that could be done in a follow up?",
