      "message": "I don\u0027t think this approach makes sense. What if you delete the first pin of three, or the second? In general, I think focus would have gone to the *next* pin. \n\nIt would be preferable to only focus the previous pin if you\u0027re explicitly on the last pin and it\u0027s being deleted.",

      "message": "Yeah you\u0027re right. It seems like focusing the next element is the default behavior for when deleting entries in most list-like structures.\n\nNew focus logic:\n- Deleting an expression --\u003e focuses next entry\n- Deleting the only expression --\u003e focus on \"Create Live Expressions\" button\n- Deleting last expression --\u003e focuses previous entry\n\nI changed the focus to the delete button since it seems like a smoother workflow.  In general, if a user is deleting an expression, I\u0027d imagine they would more likely want to delete another expression over wanting to edit an expression.\n\nAlso I added a focus function to the dt-close-button that focuses the delete button element.  It seems like it will be useful to maintain accessibility standards when using this component.",
