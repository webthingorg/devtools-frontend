      "message": "Any idea why this ends up not defined here? I\u0027m concerned we may be fixing the symptom and not the underlying bug. It particular I\u0027m curious how we end up pausing without having a stack. Perhaps there\u0027s a bug setting the data somewhere...\n\nIt looks like the data originates from the backend so we may have to go looking there for more recent changes. There was a change to the structure of the call to `DebuggerModel.DebuggerDispatcher.paused` which passes this data in about four months ago. If we look it should have a corresponding backend change https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/devtools/devtools-frontend/+/2207235\n\nI also noticed there are other places in sdk/DebuggerModel that reference debuggerPausedDetails.callFrames[0] without checking the existence. If this is expected we may need see if any of those need fixed as well.",

      "message": "This is definitely a symptom fix and not a root cause fix.  After looking at the code, I am pretty confident the issue originates from the backend as I cannot find a place where the callFrames property would be modified.\n\nI\u0027m happy to open up another bug in the backend, but investigation there will be more costly in terms of time.  I\u0027d be more comfortable knowing that in the meantime we won\u0027t enter a broken state in the DevTools.  As it is now, what would happen would be that the page will be paused, but the DevTools will assume the page is still running and give no option to resume the page.  The only option from here is to refresh everything.",
