      "message": "I think this changes the behavior and we\u0027d like to keep the previous one.\n\nPreviously, we were not returning `answer` when only the `action` is present. Now we\u0027re not returning `answer` when the `thought` is also present. We need to keep the previous behavior to handle answers such as:\n```\nTHOUGHT: X\nTITLE: X\nANSWER: X\nFIXABLE: false\n```\n\nwhich I encountered by asking \"How\u0027re you?\".\n\nIn the previous version, we were returning `answer, fixable` and now we return `thought, title, action`.\n\nCan we keep the previous behavior and only put higher priority to `thought, title, action` when the `action` is present?",
