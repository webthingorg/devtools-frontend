      "message": "Our last sync was more than 2 weeks ago: https://source.chromium.org/chromium/_/chromium/devtools/devtools-frontend/+/75eddd4ad7a8d40a9a77800093c0e9417897367c?originalUrl\u003dhttps%2F:%2F%2F%2Fcs.chromium.org%2F It seems that sync was not a proper copy, but a manual copy.\n\nIn any case, we should copy the whole `.pdl`, so we should include this change. Therefore this is WAI for me.",
