      "message": "+bmeuerer on terminology\n\nI like the idea of having a single VE for these.\n\nHowever I think we are doing away with a term `pane` now (go/chrome-devtools:simplify-terms-proposal) \n\nI also think pane is very cryptic term and communicates neither appearance nor function. The proposal suggests `tab` as a replacement, which might be fine for UI text, but I believe would be confusing here. \n\nHow about `sidebar`? We already have it in the code and it is easy to imagine what it is when hear it.",
