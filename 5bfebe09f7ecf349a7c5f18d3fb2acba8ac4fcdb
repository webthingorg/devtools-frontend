      "message": "What is the desired outcome of this change? Changing the default value will only have and effect on new DevTools users/profiles. For existing users/profiles the setting already exists and won\u0027t be affected by this change.\n\nI\u0027m not sure what else could be done though. I don\u0027t think DevTools tracks whether a user has ever changed a setting away from its default state, and turning the setting on for everyone (even those who actively turned it off) feels like an unfriendly UX pattern.",

Is that something can be removed?",
