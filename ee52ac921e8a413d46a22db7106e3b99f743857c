      "message": "Can we remove the calls to `getPendingEvents`?\n\nWhen reviewing the code, I realized that there are many copy paste errors that go along with `getPendingEvents` in many breakpoint tests. It is supposed to go along with `installEventListener`, but since `getPendingEvents` is just returning an empty list \nand thus satisfying the `waitForFunction` this went unnoticed. I\u0027ll look into the other cases.",
