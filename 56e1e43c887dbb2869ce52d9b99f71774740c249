      "message": "My understanding is that `ApplicationPanelSidebar._initialize()` can be called multiple times, which in turn each time then calls other `_initialize()` methods. It is not obvious to me why `indexedDBListTreeElement._initialize()` needs to be prevented from being called multiple times.\nWould just moving the `addModelListener()` in `IndexedDBTreeElement.initialize()` calls into its constructor be an option as well?",
