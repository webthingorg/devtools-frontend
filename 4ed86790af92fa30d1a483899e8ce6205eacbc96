      "message": "Some inline comments,  but two highlevel discussion point:\n\nAre we really sure normalizing all colors to rgb is fine? My main worry is numerical stability and that we have to remember to legalize values whenever we go to true sRGB.\n\nI\u0027m also wondering if it would be beneficial to have more structure after parsing. For example, keeping properly tokenized strings around we could show precise out-of-range errors or retain the distinction between `none` and 0 for printing (especially when colors don\u0027t have an original text).",
