All the data captured in the targets/executionContexts/scripts is still  within the traceEvents. \n\nThe natural alternative, to me, is to do this work only when we\u0027re *importing* this trace. \nAs we import, we look for the enhancedTrace signals, to know if we load in a new window.  That signal could be in the `metadata` block.  Anyway, after that we\u0027d parse all traceEvents and pull out these details so we can hydrate the rest of the devtools state.\n\nWDYT?",

      "message": "You\u0027re right about that, and I don\u0027t have a strong desire to have backwards compatibility with what Edge has already produced.\n\nHowever, we have a *strong* desire to support the rehydration mechanism for memory tooling as well. (Consider a Node or CEF application that is slowly leaking memory; after it achieves a total memory consumption of 3gb, the host application can force itself to take a heap snapshot. The Memory tool doesn\u0027t even /try/ to bind memory nodes to source locations when loading a heap snapshot from a file.)\n\nThis has been a game changer for many of our partners looking into why their apps are failing in production. I don\u0027t care about the exact layout; what I want us to be able to do is support rehydration for both the performance and the memory tools.",
