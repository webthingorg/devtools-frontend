      "message": "Always starting at 1 is going to fail in certain cases where implicit negative lines are created.\n\nTake this example: a 5x5 grid. It\u0027s row lines are going to be numbered 1 to 6. And on the negative side of things from -6 to -1 (bottom to top).\nNow, add a single item to this grid with the following positioning property: grid-row: -10;\n\nThis will create 4 new row lines towards the top, and will \"push down\" the row line 1.\n\nNow, visually, if there are no grid gaps defined, line 1 still looks like its the first line from the top, but that\u0027s only because it\u0027s at the same offset as the 4 new implicit lines that come before it.\nAdd grid-gap:1em; and you\u0027ll see that the row line 1 shifts downwards by 4em.\n\nIt looks like we have access to LayoutGrid on the backend, maybe that could be used to access the list of GridTrack instances, which seem to hold an Index property.",
