Feel free to mark it as autosubmittable.\n\nFollowing up on our breakfast discussion, I’ve confirmed that the current version in DEPS (123.0.6301.2) is fully available on the new public bucket. (bigstore/chrome-for-testing-public/123.0.6301.2)\n\nSo we can actually land this already, since the API endpoints for getting new version numbers is still frozen anyway. We’ll unfreeze it as soon as the migration is completed.",
