      "message": "I\u0027d like to keep using {linkifyScriptLocation} here. The reason being that links created via {linkifyScriptLocation} will also work with source mapping and formatted scripts. The only issue will be to wire the correct target and scriptId all the way through here and since I haven\u0027t seen the construction sites for {AffectedSource} yet, those values might not be available or feasible to obtain.\n\nWe can use {linkifyURL} for now, but as soon as we have some actual users, we should revisit. (You can also leave a TODO(chromium:1070376) here as a reminder).",
