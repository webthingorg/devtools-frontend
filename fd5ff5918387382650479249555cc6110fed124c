      "message": "Thanks, this looks great. I particularly love that we can set breakpoints by bytecode offset in wasm now. I have some leftover concerns about the API regarding installing the listeners. It might simplest to just leave the listener setup to the test. That also increases readability of the test, since I don\u0027t have to remember which function waits for what kind of effect. Alternatively we could make the APIs smarter in the event handling, but I\u0027m not convinced that\u0027s worth the effort.",

      "message": "I think this function is pretty dangerous. `listenForSourceFilesLoaded` adds a new listerner to the event, so everytime you call this function you pile on another listener. So files will appear double in the events list, even though they were opened only once. At the same time you can\u0027t really leave the listen call out because then someone might forget they have to listen first before calling the function. WDYT about just leaving this to the tests and not offering an API for it?",
