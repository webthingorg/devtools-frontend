It probably is good if the Python versions of the headless roller match with Chromium.\n\nIf that is not possible, could you let me know how `ts_library` is included in the roller?",

      "message": "It turned out the problem was specific to the roller environment, which leaked python virtual environment used to run build bot into the build itself, which resulted in \"python3\" referring to a python2 binary. This is fixed now, so I don\u0027t think this fix is relevant.\n\nThat said, you probably want to avoid python3-specific code for now as per Dirk (please see the comments here: https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/deps/icu/+/2842863) as there\u0027s still a risk of transition to python3 being reverted, at least the history there was a bit difficult.",
