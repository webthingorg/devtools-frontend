      "message": "There is quite a subtle behaviour change now which I think could be confusing.\n\n1. if the timespan label is a string, we show the duration\n2. if the timespan label is a lit-template, we do not automatically show the duration\n\nI wonder instead if actually we need another setting on entry breakdown so it becomes:\n\n```\ntype EntryBreakdown \u003d {\n  bounds: ...,\n  label: string|LitHtml.LitTemplate\n  showDuration: boolean\n}\n```\n\nAnd then we show the duration HTML based on that flag. That will allow people who want to control it fully to do so, whilst not implicitly having the duration text rendered based on if you pass a lit template into the overlay. wdyt?",
