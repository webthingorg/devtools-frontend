      "message": "UI parts LGTM, though:\n* I\u0027m having a hard time understanding which setting does what, so it\u0027d be great to move the names to constants and add comments to them.\n* I\u0027m a bit afraid that `moduleSetting()` calls throwing in the places where the setting is not defined yet. Where do we define the settings exactly and how can we make sure that `moduleSetting()` won\u0027t throw or we safely handle such throwing cases too?\n\nWe can have this discussion in sync too after the meeting :)",
