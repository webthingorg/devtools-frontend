      "message": "I would prefer not to copy these files, as that introduces quite a bit of technical debt. Instead, can we determine what the proper dependency hierarchy is and make sure that the circular dependency is not present?\n\nAs I understand it, there are some parts of `platform` that are required for the localization pipeline. Both `platform` and `i18n` are core modules, which means that we can relatively easy move functions between them.\n\nBased on this change, I am assuming the smallest fix would be to move `bytesToString` into `i18n`. Based on https://source.chromium.org/search?q\u003dbytesToString%20-f:gen%2F%20f:devtools-frontend%2F%20-f:front_end%2Fthird_party\u0026sq\u003d\u0026ss\u003dchromium I think there should be no issues moving this function into `i18n` and updating the references.\n\nAfter that, we can maintain the `i18n -\u003e platform` relationship and avoid the dependency edge back from `platform` to `i18n`. As I understand it, then all other changes are no longer required and we can avoid the copying, the changes the GRD files and don\u0027t need to update the entrypoint json files.",
