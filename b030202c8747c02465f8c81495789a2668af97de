      "message": "I would prefer not to copy these files, as that introduces quite a bit of technical debt. Instead, can we determine what the proper dependency hierarchy is and make sure that the circular dependency is not present?\n\nAs I understand it, there are some parts of `platform` that are required for the localization pipeline. Both `platform` and `i18n` are core modules, which means that we can relatively easy move functions between them.\n\nBased on this change, I am assuming the smallest fix would be to move `bytesToString` into `i18n`. Based on https://source.chromium.org/search?q\u003dbytesToString%20-f:gen%2F%20f:devtools-frontend%2F%20-f:front_end%2Fthird_party\u0026sq\u003d\u0026ss\u003dchromium I think there should be no issues moving this function into `i18n` and updating the references.\n\nAfter that, we can maintain the `i18n -\u003e platform` relationship and avoid the dependency edge back from `platform` to `i18n`. As I understand it, then all other changes are no longer required and we can avoid the copying, the changes the GRD files and don\u0027t need to update the entrypoint json files.",

      "message": "Platform is another special case as currently i18n depends on it (but it still has V1 strings), so any direct migration results in a circular dependency. To break this dependency I had to:\n- Migrate i18n to TS (linked CL).\n- Copy the format code that i18n was using from Platform, so that i18n is now a self contain module\n  with no dependencies.\n\nPTAL.",
