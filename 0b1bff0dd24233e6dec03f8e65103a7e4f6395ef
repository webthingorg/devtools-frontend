      "message": "The concern I have here is actually if we want to select the event; I think if someone has clicked on an insight, we probably don\u0027t want to select the event in the timeline - I think that would be unexpected for the user; especially when the insight is made up of multiple events.\n\nI think it would be worth extracting the \"reveal\" logic into a standalone method, and then we can call that + setSelection if we want, rather than force setSelection to also effectively act as a revealer.\n\nIt is also a bit odd that setSelection in this CL has a mode where it selects the event, but does not draw the selected outline - I think that would be confusing to the user too.",
