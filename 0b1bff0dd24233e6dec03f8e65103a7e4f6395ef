      "message": "The concern I have here is actually if we want to select the event; I think if someone has clicked on an insight, we probably don\u0027t want to select the event in the timeline - I think that would be unexpected for the user; especially when the insight is made up of multiple events.\n\nI think it would be worth extracting the \"reveal\" logic into a standalone method, and then we can call that + setSelection if we want, rather than force setSelection to also effectively act as a revealer.\n\nIt is also a bit odd that setSelection in this CL has a mode where it selects the event, but does not draw the selected outline - I think that would be confusing to the user too.",

      "message": "yeah this CL does make a lot of assumptions. I feel good about going back to just separating the logic (reveal and selection).  \n\n\u003e It is also a bit odd that setSelection in this CL has a mode where it selects the event, but does not draw the selected outline - I think that would be confusing to the user too\n\nthat\u0027s fair! this was a small feature that i chatted w Paul about offline that we both thought would be cool \u0026 make the experience (sidebar + overlay + summary panel/bottom drawer) more functional hehe. but yeah, this was not something openly discussed or agreed upon :)",
