      "message": "I\u0027ve added two small unit tests. I initially tried to actually start a Node target (node_app.js), and check the result of this method properly. However, creating/attaching targets will lead to a lot of unrelated things being done (e.g. a new DebuggerModel is created), with promises being started that are not properly awaited. In the end I reverted to the simple, small test. Let me know if you want me to change anything.",
