      "message": "Yeah, the issue is not the rendering, but that `await` in front of `invoke_runBounceTrackingMitigations` which interrupts the control flow for the first time. At this point there\u0027s no work in the rendering queue so `coordinator.done()` resolves immediately. \n\nThis could have worked just as well with \n\n    await new Promise((resolve) \u003d\u003e setTimeout(resolve, 0));\n    await coordinator.done();\n    \n    \nIn fact both patterns are common in our code base. Thanks for brining this to my attention. With the http://crrev.com/c/4502862 you can now do `await coordinator.done({waitForWork:true});` which would block until something actually gets rendered.",
