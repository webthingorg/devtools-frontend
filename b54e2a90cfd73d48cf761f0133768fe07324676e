      "message": "This is currently listed under unstable experiments, so I am surprised that this is to be enabled by default. So I played around a bit with this, and found that it doesn\u0027t really work that well.\n\nFor example:\n- I try to add a short cut to close all sources windows via Command+W. Surprise: that closes the entire browser window.\n- I try to add a short cut to close all sources windows via Option+W. Surprise: it records that as `⌥ Σ` even though there is already another action successfully mapped to `⌥ W` by default.\n\nI found these issues within five minutes, so I\u0027m not entirely convinced this is ready to be enabled by default yet.",
