We are currently migrating DevTools UI to Material 3, and a lot of UI will be updated to be in sync with Chrome. This includes landing pages (https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12kY2tn84xfYD421OTeXMIHpvWoMne2Z06erfpM7-l-w/#slide\u003did.g29c79b73930_3_206).\n\nProbably, we want to declutter and have one image for landing pages. In any case, we should start talking if you want to have a new landing page in order to synchronize with our UX (except if you have talked to petermueller@ about its design).",
