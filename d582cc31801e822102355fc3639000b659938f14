(It\u0027s linked to the branded types bug, but this change isn\u0027t doing any branding.) Can you give an example of what the bad behavior you\u0027re fixing is? Is it something that can be tested?",

Is there a reason we\u0027re including the fragment? I also wonder if this is another place where it makes sense to say, if there is a fragment, leave it encoded like the url since it won\u0027t look like a normal filename.",

If we\u0027re using the full url, we either want the name to be the url (encoded), or the url is actually a path, which I would expect is already unencoded.
