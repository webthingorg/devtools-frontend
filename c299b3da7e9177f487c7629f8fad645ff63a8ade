      "message": "While the change here is a quick fix and good on its own, it does worry me that esbuild\u0027s behavior is already different for one of our leaf modules compared to TypeScript. The risk we are running here is that the DevTools build completes, but then once we get to Chromium, it suddenly fails. The discrepancy in behavior between the tools will create headaches for us, which I would like to avoid.\n\nThat said, if it is possible to align the tools to come to an agreement what the behavior should be and we can make that consistent, we would be able to maintain the invariant that a Chromium build succeeds when a DevTools build succeeds.\n\nSo given this is a tiny fix, I don\u0027t see any reason not to apply it. But if we end up with larger fixes where esbuild wants one thing and TypeScript does another, I am less comfortable with that.",

But it seems not true and this is a caveat not known until now.\n\nLuckily, I only see this build error when replacing tsc with esbuild or swc so far.\nAnd if we concern difference of build success, I think we can mitigate that by having another builder using esbuild or swc in this repository (or use esbuild/swc in devtools_frontend_linux_blink_light_rel?)",
