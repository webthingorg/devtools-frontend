      "message": "The changes to margin re-distribute the whitespace in the ReportView more evenly. There white-space is now at the bottom of each row of the CSS grid. This means that there is no extra margin needed for the dividers between sections.\n\nSetting the width of the 2nd grid column to `1fr` instead of `auto` ensures that the column takes up the whole remaining space, whereas a width of `auto` is also somewhat influenced by the size of its content.\n\nSetting the `min-width` of ReportValues to 0 achieves that these grid cells are allowed to shrink beyond the size of their content. This means that long URLs do not cause the grid cells to grow, but that we are instead able to achieve a cutoff with ellipsis (\u0027https://blablabl...\u0027).\n\nThe only other place using the ReportView is the `RequestTrustTokensView`, for which I checked that it still looks fine.",
