      "message": "I totally agree. I\u0027d usually go for the extra effort and acomodate as much as I can to retain/add new components and retire legacy ones, but in this case the legacy TreeOutline is too complex to port/recreate in the new component world (the ARIA logic is several hundreds LOC), and retaining \u003cComputedStyleGroupLists\u003e would mean some nasty wrangling of legacy UI into our new component world. I don\u0027t think we\u0027d want that.\n\nOn a related note, I\u0027m very aware of this TreeOutline challange and want to change this overtime. I\u0027m slowly typescriptifying ui/TreeOutline.js, and I\u0027ll figure out the next step after that.",
