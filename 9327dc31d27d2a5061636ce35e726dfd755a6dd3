      "message": "I\u0027m not totally sure I\u0027m following the logic in this CL, but I suspect this\nline is wrong and is introducing a build determinism failure in chrome (see crbug.com/1190355).\n\nBy setting data_deps \u003d public_deps, you\u0027re saying that every file that is a\ncompile-time dependency is also a runtime_dependency.\n\nIf you combine this with the logic on line 160 of \n//third_party/typescript/typescript.gni, which declares the *.tsbuildinfo\nfile as an output of a target, you\u0027re saying that the *.tsbuildinfo file\nis a runtime dependency of the frontend, which (a) I doubt is correct, and\n(b) is causing issues, since it looks like TSC is producing non-deterministic\nfiles for that.\n\nHowever, I\u0027m not sure what the best way to fix this is. I\u0027m not sure if\nthe .tsbuildinfo files really need to be declared as outputs; do other\ntargets depend on them?",
