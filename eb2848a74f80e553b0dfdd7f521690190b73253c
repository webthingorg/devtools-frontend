You\u0027re making multiple changes here at once:\n\n- Move ownership of the plugin manager to workspace bindings\n- Turn the manager into a model observer\n- Introduce a new raw module id\n\nThose are the ones I got at a first glance at least. Are these interdependant so that they need to happen in a single CL?",
