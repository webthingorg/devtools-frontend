      "message": "This is looking good, but could it be broken up into smaller pieces? That would improve readability and revertability of the CL. You\u0027re making multiple changes here at once:\n\n- Move ownership of the plugin manager to workspace bindings\n- Turn the manager into a model observer\n- Introduce a new raw module id\n\nThose are the ones I got at a first glance at least. Are these interdependant so that they need to happen in a single CL?",

      "message": "This is already only a piece of the overall puzzle, and I\u0027m not sure I can split this up further with individual steps that make sense:\n\n- The raw module ID change I suppose could be done separately, but it\u0027s likely not very useful.\n- The model observer and ownership/singleton change go hand-in-hand, one doesn\u0027t make sense without the other.",
