      "message": "Q: Did you update the files in `node_modules` manually? We update those projects via a script \"manage_node_deps.py\" where we specify the versions of the npm package. This seems suspect, as the `package.json.lock` gets out of sync with what is actually in `node_modules`.\n\nThe `node_modules` browser_protocol.pdl is not really used by DevTools itself, but by the bundled puppeteer, so this could even cause problems with the bundled puppeteer.\n\nIdeally a CL like this is created using the `roll_deps.py` script + `npm run generate-protocol-resources`, but I\u0027m fine with removing the `node_modules` changes and than landing.",
