      "message": "UPD: The main issue is that a clip for a given node is calculated BEFORE emulation, while emulation changes the position of the node, which leads to making a screenshot of the wrong area.\n\nOne of the approaches to solve the issue can be like in the example: https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/devtools/devtools-frontend/+/2466178",

It appears to work in all cases. \n\nI\u0027m not sure where all these extra added scripts/component_bridges/... files came from however - maybe you can provide some insight into what they may be? I did rebase before implementing the changes and thought that may be the cause.",
