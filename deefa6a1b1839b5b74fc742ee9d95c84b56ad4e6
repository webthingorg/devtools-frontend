      "message": "Mathias, a few questions for you:\n\n* Could you double-check that I didn\u0027t mess anything up in terms of wiring up the actual front-end changes? The unit tests pass, but I\u0027m not sure how to build DevTools to do an end-to-end test.\n\n* It\u0027s not totally obvious to me how we want to land these CLs. I think we can (1) disable auto-rolling, (2) land the Chromium side, and then (3) land this side. Does that sound right? If so, could you put together a CL for (1)? It\u0027s hopefully pretty straightforward, but I\u0027m not sure what exactly that would take.\n\n* I\u0027m not sure whether this CL keeps the GRD translation bits correctly wired up – I don\u0027t really know how those get substituted. Could you please pay extra attention to whether there is anything needed to keep translations working as expected?",
