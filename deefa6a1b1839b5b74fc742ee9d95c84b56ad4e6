      "message": "Mathias, a few questions for you:\n\n* Could you double-check that I didn\u0027t mess anything up in terms of wiring up the actual front-end changes? The unit tests pass, but I\u0027m not sure how to build DevTools to do an end-to-end test.\n\n* It\u0027s not totally obvious to me how we want to land these CLs. I think we can (1) disable auto-rolling, (2) land the Chromium side, and then (3) land this side. Does that sound right? If so, could you put together a CL for (1)? It\u0027s hopefully pretty straightforward, but I\u0027m not sure what exactly that would take.\n\n* I\u0027m not sure whether this CL keeps the GRD translation bits correctly wired up – I don\u0027t really know how those get substituted. Could you please pay extra attention to whether there is anything needed to keep translations working as expected?",

      "message": "- After building DevTools per https://chromium.googlesource.com/devtools/devtools-frontend/+/HEAD/docs/workflows.md, it should be possible to run the end-to-end tests via `npm run e2etest`. More details here: https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/master:third_party/devtools-frontend/src/test/e2e/README.md\n\n- I don\u0027t think we need to disable any auto-rollers. (The roll_deps.py is only run manually when needed.) We can 1) land the Chromium CL, then 2) land this CL.\n\n- Looks fine. In general, PRESUBMIT should complain if something is missing in terms of localization.",

I\u0027m able to run `npm run e2etest`... but do we have a programmatic end-to-end test for this?\n\n(It\u0027s hard to tell based on the output of e2etest – most tests pass, but a few seemingly unrelated ones fail, which I\u0027d intuitively expect to be an indication of flakiness... though maybe this CL is actually breaking seemingly unrelated things?)",

      "message": "Apologies, I should have clarified. There indeed is no e2e test specifically for this feature. We prefer unit tests in general (and we have them for this feature, yay!), and tend to write e2e tests for things that are historically not suitable for unit tests.\n\nYes, we currently have some flakiness issues with some of the e2e tests. I don\u0027t think it\u0027s related to your CL. I\u0027d say the things to watch out for before landing this CL are:\n\n- Ensure `autoninja -C out/Default` works (a debug build)\n- Ensure `autoninja -C out/Release` works (a build with is_debug\u003dfalse in gn args)\n- Ensure Closure is happy: `npm run check-type-closure`",
