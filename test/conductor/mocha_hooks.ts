// We can run Mocha in two modes: serial and parallel. In parallel mode, Mocha
// starts multiple node processes which don't know about each other. It
// provides them one test file at a time, and when they are finished with that
// file they ask for another one. This means in parallel mode, the unit of work
// is a test file, and a full setup and teardown is done before/after each file
// even if it will eventually run another test file. This is inefficient for us
// because we have a relatively long setup time, but we can't avoid it at the
// moment. It also means that the setup and teardown code needs to be aware
// that it may be run multiple times within the same node process.
