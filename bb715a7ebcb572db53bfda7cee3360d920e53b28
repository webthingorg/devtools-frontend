However, since we don\u0027t want to include `.d.ts` files in our release bundle, the `.d.ts` file should *not* be added to either `data` or `grd_files` in the metadata. It might be easiest to rename this variable to `js_outputs` and then do `outputs \u003d js_outputs + [ \"$target_gen_dir/IconButton.css.d.ts\" ]` here. You would then use `js_outputs` for your `data` and `grd_files`.",

The error you were seeing when it was added to the `deps` was probably because the generated `.d.ts` file was the wrong name.\n\nIf you have a file \"Foo.js\", then you need a \"Foo.d.ts\" for the TypeScript declarations. Since your filename is \"IconButton.css.js\", that means the declaration file should be named \"IconButton.css.d.ts\" (e.g. replace the `.js` part with `.d.ts` and leave the rest alone)",
