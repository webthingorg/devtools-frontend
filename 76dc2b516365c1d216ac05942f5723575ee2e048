      "message": "PTAL at the latest revision to adapt to new trace engine and let me know what you think. Seems like `RendererHandler.ts` might fit better than `WorkerHandler.ts` since postMessages can happen on iframes and other non-worker contexts as well but open to thoughts on this.\n\nAre there any plans to migrate the `EventOnTimeline` class out of `TimelineModel.ts`? I currently import this class to create the relationship in the handler since this is being used elsewhere in the initiator logic.\n\nI also noticed there seems to be bug to support showing the arrow lines for events coming from the new engine? \n[crbug.com/1434596](`https://chromium.googlesource.com/devtools/devtools-frontend/+/refs/heads/main/front_end/panels/timeline/TimelineFlameChartDataProvider.ts#1424`)\n\nThe initiator info still shows up in the details page but not the arrow lines.",
