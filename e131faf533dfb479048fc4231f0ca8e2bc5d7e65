      "message": "Correct, the .fill class seems very generic and used in many places. What I\u0027m suggesting is for you to override its `right` value just in your particular case, by using any parent CSS class selector that you need to make it specific.\n\nI don\u0027t have a strong preference by the way. The element you are trying to fix with `.request-initiator-view-tree.tree-outline li .selection` also has the `.fill` class, and as such is positioned absolutely with `right:0`. I just feel it\u0027s a little cleaner to override `right` instead of adding yet another positioning technique on top with `margin-right`.\n\nHopefully this is a bit clearer :)",
