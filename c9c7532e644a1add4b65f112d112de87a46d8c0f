      "message": "I can\u0027t really put my finger on it, but this options a little feels too karma-specific. What would you think about something like this:\n\nDefault: log-level\u003dwarn\n--verbose, -v: log-level\u003dinfo\n-vv: log-level\u003ddebug\n\nThat would more align with what I\u0027m used to from command line tools. We could also add expanded-reporting on one of the two verbose levels. WDYT? I\u0027m sure we can also improve the logging for e2e tests a bit!",

      "message": "Interesting - for me the Karma options of `info`, `warn`, `error` are pretty consistent with most other tools.\n\nI\u0027d push back against your proposal because it doesn\u0027t let me reduce the log level - I want `--log-level\u003derror` the majority of the time. \n\nHappy to include a `--verbose` flag, but it needs to also provide a way to reduce the logging to a minimum ðŸ˜Š",
