      "message": "I am currently doing analogous work i.e. investigating how to make DevTools correctly handle frame activations and mostly treat them similar to main frame navigations.\n\nI am experimenting with introducing a `frameActivated` event (https://crrev.com/c/4296547 which is very much WIP), which would be triggered by CDP\u0027s `Target.targetInfoChanged`. I believe the relevant `targetInfoChanged` events would be fired more or less at similar times to the `prerenderAttemptCompleted` events. And the `frameActivated` would give you direct access to the frame, so you wouldn\u0027t need the `prerenderingUrlToLoaderId` map anymore.\n\nWDYT? Would this work for your use case here?",
