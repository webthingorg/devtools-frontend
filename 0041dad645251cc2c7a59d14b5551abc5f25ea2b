      "message": "bundle files in dt usually export the content of all files in the module like \n```\nimport * as FileName1 from \u0027Filename1.ts\u0027\nimport * as FileName2 from \u0027Filename2.ts\u0027\n...\n\nexport {\n  FileName1,\n  FileName2\n  ...\n}\n```\n\nI think the way we are doing it here should work with dt bundling so using this pattern is not strictly required, but the way we import stuff from this module would look a bit different. I don\u0027t feel strongly about it tho but maybe it\u0027s worth considering if the refactoring to accomodate to this is straight forward. If it is turns out being too much refactoring then feel free to ignore. (sorry for not catching this before). (same for metrics.ts)",
