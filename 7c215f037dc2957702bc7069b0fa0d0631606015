Apparently there are some logic when user uses keyboard space and enter browsing through the empty state list item (open file, run command), DevTools should fire a corresponding command to trigger the action)\n\nI am not sure since when it\u0027s not working (tested in M116 nt working as well), but I didn\u0027t knw it has this hidden feature (nt sure if it\u0027s a11y related).\n\nTempted to do a clean up or fix it, but not in the scope of this CL.",
