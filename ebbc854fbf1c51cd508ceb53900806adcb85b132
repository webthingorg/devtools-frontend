      "message": "I would prefer not to make an API change of an abstract method if only 1 of the child classes actually implements it. Can we instead change the 1 instance where we need to add the icon to manually construct it, outside of `renderItem`? We can maybe design an API that would allow us to retrieve the `uiSourceCode` separately and then render that in the `wrapperElement`?",

So in the previous patch it was a method used by the user of this, and I requested it to be a parameter instead (but the current state contains both.\n\nA bit of context:\nSo before, Nancy had a function that was called `renderIcon` and one function that would render it. These two functions were added to the FilteredListWidget.\nSince these two methods were basically only used in `FilteredUISourceCodeListProvider` I asked if Nancy could change it to only be taken care of in the `FilteredUISourceCodeListProvider` (and to remove the two other functions).\n\nThe reasoning for me to add the `wrapperElement` to `renderItem` is that each Provider knows how to render its item that is shown in the list, and it feels as if the caller shouldn\u0027t know about that (how to render it). I agree though that now the wrapperElement is only used in the `FilteredUISourceCodeListProvider.ts`. So maybe we can find an alternative. WDYT?",
