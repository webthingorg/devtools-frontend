I would like to use the same template as SupportsReducedData in RenderingOptions.ts but `window` is undefined in the test file.\n\nI notice there are a lot of test helpers but I don\u0027t know which ones would be relevant for my case, and thought it might be faster just to ask you guys.\n\nBTW currently the test passes because we display prefers-contrast emulation in the DevTools unconditionally.",
