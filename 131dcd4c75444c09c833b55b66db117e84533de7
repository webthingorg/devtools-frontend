The rule exists because some screen readers have problems with that. Since you\u0027re more familiar with dev tools, would you be willing to help me out a bit with the test failures?\n\nBasically we can\u0027t put aria-label on a plain div, because it has role\u003dgeneric, and screen readers are not happy about that.",
