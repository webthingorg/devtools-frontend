      "message": "Issue https://crbug.com/1284245 describes two related problems. The second is semantic cursors (for pen or mouse, not finger). z-index is required for the second problem. Without it the pointer for spectrum dragger is always \u0027crosshair\u0027 (as for parent spectrum color element) instead of expected \u0027move\u0027 cursor.\n\nYou can try it live yourself (https://crbug.com/1284245#c1), remove z-index by inspecting DevTools by DevTools and ensure that it\u0027s really required. ;-)",
