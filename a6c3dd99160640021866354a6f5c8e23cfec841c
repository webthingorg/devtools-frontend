      "message": "By setting this flag to true, we tell `ts_library` to keep track of the timestamps precompilation and the corresponding content. Then, when `tsc` is done, we compare the contents and if it is equal to what it was before, we reset the timestamp.\n\nWe only do this in `devtools_module` atm, but we don\u0027t do it in `devtools_entrypoint` (to avoid the non-determinism when rolling up). Before this CL, `devtools_module` was the only usage of this flag. With this cl, we now also include Node targets, which were never affected by the non-determinism in our production build.",
