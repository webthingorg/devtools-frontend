I think expanding the first category is okay as we\u0027re keeping the test cases simple and it\u0027s consistent with the behavior of expandIssue (which always expands the first issue). \n\nIf we need more complex tests in the future I could see enhancing both expandCategory and expandIssue to accept a string specifying which category/issue to expand based on the name/message, but personally I\u0027d prefer to wait until we need it.",
