      "message": "Why do we need to use computedStyles if parentComputedStyles is undefined? When would it actually be undefined? It seems to me like we should assert somewhere that it never is. A flex item has got to have a parent container. And because flex-direction does not inherit, getting the item\u0027s computed value for flex-direction will be incorrect.",

That means even if the #item div is a grand-child of the #container div, it still gets promoted as a flex item.\nSo, node.parentNode isn\u0027t going to help us retrieve the right computed style in this case.\n\nNow, display:contents is likely rarely used these days, and I think its main purpose (before subgrid existed) was to let people use css grid on things like \u003cul\u003e lists where the ul would be the container, but the li would not be items, they\u0027d be removed with display:contents, so their content could be positioned on the grid.\n\nSo, what I\u0027m saying here is: this is incorrect, but might be enough for 99% of the cases, and so maybe we can live with a simple //TODO comment and address later.",
