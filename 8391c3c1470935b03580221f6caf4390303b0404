WDYT?\n\nI didn\u0027t want to go with a specific attribute on the button like `\u003cButton norightsidebar\u003dfalse\u003e` to have a more generic customization option for the button.\n\nIn all cases, I don\u0027t have strong preferences and would be fine with implementing all the solutions :) So, do you have a preference over any of the solutions, if not, can you review and tell me what you think about the `Modifier` idea and the CL? üòÖ",

      "message": "I agree that having both Variant and Modifier can be confusing.\n\nThough from the idea perspective, they are different concepts and if we\u0027re able to explain it well with a documentation, they might both live at the same time.\n* Variant: the \"type\" of the button, it essentially makes the button a significantly different one. `\u003cButton variant\u003d\"PRIMARY\"\u003e and `\u003cButton variant\u003d\"SECONDARY\"\u003e` It feels like they are different components at this point (like `\u003cPrimaryButton\u003e` and `\u003cSecondaryButton\u003e`)\n* Modifier: the type of the visual change we allow that can be applicable for all button variants. \"No right side border\", \"No border\" etc.\n\nThough, it also shows that changing the `Modifier` is easy and in the future I\u0027m afraid that the combination of these two can lead to a lot of different Button types.\n\nOther fear is that, people can use `Modifiers` instead of `Variant` even for bigger visual changes. i.e. `Modifier.RedBackground` instead of having a `Variant.DANGER` maybe and where to put a divide between these two can be confusing.\n\nSo, I propose another thing in this regard: having a boolean CSS variable (see http://crrev/c/3613884).\n* This restricts the type of border-radius we can have (i.e. people can\u0027t use it to set the border radius to whatever they want)\n* It doesn\u0027t bloat the API and solves our problem subtly.\nWDYT?",
