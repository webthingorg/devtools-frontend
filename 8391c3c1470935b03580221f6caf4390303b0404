      "message": "I would rather we land a configuration to enable you to select the border radius (e.g. XS, S, M, L, XL or similar) rather than any px value, because that will lead to more inconsistencies, wdyt?\n\nI am happy with the change broadly assuming that Peter is happy and has approved the design on the \"measure performance\" button that needs a different radius.",
