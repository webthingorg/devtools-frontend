      "message": "On my computer, when I open devtools, body is always expanded by default. If I press twice the right arrow key then, I move down to the first child of body, and then expand that element.\nIt\u0027s not a problem since we\u0027d still be selecting that element, but isn\u0027t it weird that this test sometimes requires 2 key presses to work? I\u0027ve seen other tests do the same thing, and not be flaky. I\u0027m wondering why this one is different.",

      "message": "I am not sure why it is different from other tests but I assume the expansion of the body is not sync so it might be that it gets selected and expanded later. So if you press the down key, it goes to the html element. I saw that the html element was selected in the screenshots taken after failure.",
