      "message": "On my computer, when I open devtools, body is always expanded by default. If I press twice the right arrow key then, I move down to the first child of body, and then expand that element.\nIt\u0027s not a problem since we\u0027d still be selecting that element, but isn\u0027t it weird that this test sometimes requires 2 key presses to work? I\u0027ve seen other tests do the same thing, and not be flaky. I\u0027m wondering why this one is different.",
