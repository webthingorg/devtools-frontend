      "message": "Hi Almothana!\n\nI have added a new \"selector\"; or rather a waitForFunction that checks how many elements are expanded. I hope this helps with the flickering test? It runs through for me; so I hope it does for you too.\n\nI have also fixed a few more things (replaced variable naming with \u0027_\u0027 to only use camel case, using \u0027mainWasm\u0027 instead of \u0027main\u0027 to make it unique as that failed for me, and some minor other changes).\n\nI hope it is fine that I uploaded a patch set; I figured that if I already have the changes it would make sense to directly upload them.\n\nPTAL, otherwise it looks good to me :)! If you commit, please make sure to change the commit message such that you\u0027re the author of the CL. I\u0027m adding Benedikt also as reviewer now.",
