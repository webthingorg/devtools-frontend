But it seems that everything we are looking to do here is to skip stack trace produced in the `ConsoleViewMessage.tryFormatAsError`. Can we put a dedicated CSS class on it, take a `deepTextContent` of the whole thing, then a `deepTextContent` of a stack trace we want to skip, and replace this string with an empty string in the first string?",

I am bit hesitant to change the console message structure but I can give it a try.",
