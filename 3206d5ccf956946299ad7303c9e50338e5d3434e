      "message": "LightHouse OWNERS FYI: we have to change the file extension for the LightHouse sources to `.mjs` to let esbuild correctly deduce that these files are intended to be loaded as ES modules rather than Common JS. For now we are making the change locally, but for the next LightHouse roll we will need to have the new file extensions in the script. Do you mind making these changes in your build scripts as well?",
