      "message": "I tried again and this test cannot get control back to the lighthouse tab after audits are done. Would you like to rewrite the waitForResult helper? Currently, I am not sure why it\u0027s written that way: as waitForFunction would always return a truthy value. Perhaps it can be rewritten in a way that it focuses on the frontend tab and if the results are not there, it focuses back to the target?",
