As mentioned in the description, it won\u0027t be merged until the blink-side changes are merged.\n\nSounds good. If you like, feel free to mark it as Code-Review: -1 until the upstream changes are merged, so that it cannot accidentally land.\n\n\u003e I\u0027m not familiar with how the processes in this repo work. I noticed that the presubmit updated some localization .jsons by emptying them. I was wondering if this is intentional or due to a mistake on my end.\n\nI don’t think that’s supposed to happen… Simon, have you seen this before?\n\n\u003e Otherwise, I\u0027m not really sure how the front-end is tested, beyond opening a local build of Chrome and poking around the emulation (it works! at least it worked before the presubmit checks).\n\nTake a look at test/e2e/rendering/Rendering_test.ts, you could add an e2e test there following the existing examples. test/e2e/README.md contains more information.",

I was not able to reproduce this behavior with this CL, here are the steps I tried:\n\n1) Patched in this CL\n2) Reverted the changes to the locale json files\n\n3) Run `npm run collect-strings` OR `git cl presubmit`\n\nBoth options in 3) correctly added the new string RenderingOptions.ts to en-US and en-XL and left the others alone.\n\nAre you running the scripts on windows?
