      "message": "Hi Mathias, this should be the front-end work needed to emulate prefers-contrast in the Rendering tab of devtools. As mentioned in the description, it won\u0027t be merged until the blink-side changes are merged.\n\nI\u0027m not familiar with how the processes in this repo work. I noticed that the presubmit updated some localization .jsons by emptying them. I was wondering if this is intentional or due to a mistake on my end.\n\nOtherwise, I\u0027m not really sure how the front-end is tested, beyond opening a local build of Chrome and poking around the emulation (it works! at least it worked before the presubmit checks).\n\nThanks!",
