      "message": "I tested the functionality locally and it works great!\n\nUX-wise this currently adds a \"Run test\" button at the top of the page without any further explanation. I don\u0027t think the button\u0027s function is self-explanatory, it would be great if we gave the users some more guidance. Some ideas:\n- add a hover text explanation to the button\n- move the button into the 2 column layout and place a description of the button\u0027s functionality right next to the button\n- Location of the button: does the location at the very top make the most sense or would a different spot make more sense?\n\nWDYT?\n",
