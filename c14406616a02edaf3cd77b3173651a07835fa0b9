Turns out that the background color workaround was coming from https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/devtools/devtools-frontend/+/3136215 In this case, I think it is better to revert that change for now and figure out a better solution for the dark mode issue. Added Victor as FYI on this CL about the context for the change.\n\nI will submit this CL on Monday!",
