We don\u0027t currently update the `Attribution-Reporting-Eligible` header in that situation, which is definitely confusing: https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:third_party/blink/renderer/core/frame/attribution_src_loader.cc;l\u003d477-478;drc\u003df26bb66a0f935f7c677cbc47ff809c13968b4db3\n\nI\u0027m including that text here so that devs that encounter that problem have at least some indication of what\u0027s happening. In the future, we may change behavior related to that.",
