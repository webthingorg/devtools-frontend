      "message": "I have not run these tests, because I couldn\u0027t figure out how to do so. The docs that I found give a single command, \"npm run auto-unittest\". However, (a) the scripts directory doesn\u0027t seem to be hooked up, and (b) it\u0027s not really clear what tests are being run, nor how to tweak the command to run a specific test. Are there more detailed docs somewhere, or is this just tribal knowledge?\n\n(To re-iterate: I realize that this code probably belongs in a different location, and probably that location is \"easier\" to run tests for. Still, most of what I wrote above applies for tests in the front_end directory as well.)\n\nWhile on the topic of docs: I did not find any docs that explained how to install NPM, including in the Googler onboarding docs. I ended up figuring out *a* way to do so, but the docs really are hard to follow as a new developer in this codebase. Not sure whether anyone is particularly maintaining them?",
