      "message": "Thanks for having a look Al! We actually have a `waitFor` in the click helper that is used below, see: https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:third_party/devtools-frontend/src/test/shared/helper.ts;l\u003d102;drc\u003dad06e71b058ef1f89eca366d959ae51f33f9911e. This was recently changed. The `performActionOnSelector` doesn\u0027t seem to recognize `aria` as the queryHandler though since we use a different syntax, and if your change makes a difference, maybe we should use the click helper with `aria/CSP Violation Breakpoints\u0027 instead? I.e.:\n\n`await click(\u0027aria/CSP Violation Breakpoints\u0027)`",
