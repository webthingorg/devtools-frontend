      "message": "Since hooks can now run multiple times, or only once, can we add comments to the various hooks/function and state how often they are running? That makes a bit clearer what the invariants are and whether you need to clear state or not.\n\nAlso, given our infra problems this week, I propose submitting this next week at the earliest.\n\nLastly, I will need to test this locally. Do you have any suggestions on what scenarios to test?",

      "message": "Iirc you did some experiments as to what the optimal number of tasks are vs computation resources. With using the number of `testFiles`, we are essentially unbounded, as we are growing ad infinitum.\n\nShould we maybe limit to like 16 for now? That should at least give us a bit more determinism in terms of computational performance. Hopefully that also improves the amount of overhead.",
