      "message": "thx :)  \n\n\u003e Alternatively, we could just improve the speed of regular\nincremental builds.\n\nI managed to push this forward a tad.  `autoninja -C out/Default -d explain -vv` provides some useful output. My initial interpretation is that the `generate-tsconfig` stuff is kinda at fault. Feels like any TS file change invalidates the tsconfig, but the tsconfig in-turn invalidates a LOT of related files. And it then invalidates upwards into various `xx-entrypoint-tsconfig.json`s and that invalidates a bunch of frontend TS all over. \n\nNext, I managed to dump the ninja build graph as a visualization.  `autoninja -C out/Default/ -t graph front_end/models/trace/handlers/`  outputs some graphviz dot stuff. (Definitely need a smallish subfolder).  Then paste into http://magjac.com/graphviz-visual-editor/ and.. wait like 5 minutes? (Shrug)\nScreencap exploring it a tad: https://www.paulirish.com/i/ninja-build-graph-cdt.webm\n\nAnyway.. I think I may know what\u0027s at fault here.. stay tuned :)",
