      "message": "Having two separate tests is nice, but I feel what\u0027s more important is to have a single E2E that captures the whole journey:\n\n```\n1.) Navigate\n2.) Set breakpoint 1\n3.) Reload\n--- Breakpoint 1 hit ---\n4.) Remove breakpoint 1\n5.) Set breakpoint 2 later\n6.) Reload again\n--- Breakpoint 2 hit ---\n```\n\nThis ensures that we also test the state that is held in the front-end and back-end. I talked to Kim about this in the morning.",
