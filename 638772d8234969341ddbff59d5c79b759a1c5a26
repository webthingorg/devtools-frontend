      "message": "Hi Mathias and Changhao,\n\nI\u0027ve started looking at a testing plan for Annabel, and am hoping to add some of the initial helpers for the accessibility panel. I\u0027m having a little trouble though. Basically, I\u0027m not sntirely sure how exactly to open the accessibility panel. Using debug-e2etest has led me to believe that it\u0027s because the activator for the Accessibility pane is hidden inside the \"More tabs\" chevron, but I also can\u0027t successfully click on the \"More tabs\" chevron either.\n\nDo either of you have any advice about how to proceed? Cheers.",
