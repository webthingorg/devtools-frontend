Once it\u0027s re-landed, Chrome for Testing (in which the e2e tests are run) needs to be rolled to a version which includes your Chromium changes (roll CLs: https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/q/owner:devtools-ci-autoroll-builder@chops-service-accounts.iam.gserviceaccount.com). This should fix the `afterAll` error, but I believe the actual test itself will need an additional fix.",
