      "message": "You\u0027re totally right actually! They were unevenly spaced. I added the line-height to the `.helper` div so that the lines will be spaced evenly and they will have a line-height suitable for the outline to not overlap with the text. WDYT?",

      "message": "If you go to the Sources panel and tab to the \"Learn More\" link in the preview toggle on the left, there is some overlap with the surrounding text there too, so it would be good to come up with a fix that works both places. I think that wrapping these links in divs (in PreviewToggle.ts) and putting the padding on them would work, and we don\u0027t really want these controls to take up more vertical space if they don\u0027t need to. That said, setting the line height on an element higher in the tree would work too.",

So, the lines will be evenly spaced\n* Does not add additional line height if there isn\u0027t link inside so it doesn\u0027t capture more vertical space if the component doesn\u0027t need it.",
