      "message": "Moving i18n to TS. I found that this was the best approach to tackle a circular dependency that I found when migrating platform module to i18n (as currently i18n depends on platform ðŸ˜„). It is pretty much the same code my guess is not detecting one rename based on the fixes I had to do for the Typescript migration. Tried to keep the shape and bug you were using, let me know if you have comments.",

(My current understanding is that these `any`s are not explicitly required, but I might be missing some context) Instead, please use `unknown`, as it ensures any usages of the variable have be checked. With `any`, the usage will be silently accepted, leading to errors down the line.\n\nIf these errors do need to be suppressed, please add an explanation as to why that is the case and a potential resolution option on how we can remove these.",
