      "message": "Why is the re-wrapping required? `Promise.prototype.then` always returns a new pending promise that fulfills once the passed `promise` fulfills.\n\nSo this should be equivalent with one less promise?\n\n```\nthis.#queue \u003d this.#queue.then(() \u003d\u003e promise);\nreturn this.#queue;\n```\n\nFor these kinds of primitives it would be nice to have a unit test to show exactly what problem they solve. We have `Platform.PromiseUtilities.promiseWithResolver` as a nice helper to setup various scenarios.",
