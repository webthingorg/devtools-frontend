      "message": "(nit, let\u0027s not block on this): I think I\u0027m having a hard time understanding which test cases this test covers.\n\nNow, there is a setup for multiple cases (own variable, inherited variable, registered variable) and multiple assertions based on this setup. I think I\u0027d prefer to have a single setup and single assertion in a test so that we can understand for exactly which case we had a concern and how that concern is resolved at the end.\n\nI\u0027d prefer to abstract setting the test and writing multiple test cases for `correctly resolves the declaration` like maybe in a `correctly resolves the declaration` block and continues with `when the variable is a registered one with initial value` etc. WDYT?",
