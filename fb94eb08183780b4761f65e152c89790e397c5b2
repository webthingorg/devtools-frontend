      "message": "lgtm.\n\nThe impl seems to be busted due to a `INVALID_OPERATION: drawArrays: no buffer is bound to enabled attribute` error (at the least).\n\nI did profile the two approaches and the webgl one is faster. For 2D canvas we pay a 3-5ms cost of `Canvas2DLayerBridge::flushRecording` on the main thread during Paint. So, there may be some future where we resurrect this code to improve perf, though it seems somewhat unlikely. :)",
