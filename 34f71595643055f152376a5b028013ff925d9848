(okay.. very stupid).\n\nThe good news is that it\u0027s probably somewhat reasonable to move these out of this trace category. We could try that if we want.",

      "message": "YUP. That\u0027s 90% of the reason why it hasn\u0027t been resolved. A little scary cuz its challenging to know who breaks.\n\nMy guess is we\u0027d have to check RPP, NPP, catapult/traceviewer, and perfetto. And there\u0027s a mailing list of tooling vendors we could FYI to. That\u0027d get us 85% of the way. \nAnyway. I\u0027m not strongly suggesting it right now. Just sharing the context for when we get our confidence. :)",
