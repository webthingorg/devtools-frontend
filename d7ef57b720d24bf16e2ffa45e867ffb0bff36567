      "message": "This test was exercising a custom `paste` event handler, that was making sure that plain text was inserted instead of the formatted text. `contenteditable\u003d\"plaintext-only\"` does the same, but since we don\u0027t need to prevent default on the `paste` event, we get an `input` event with `inputType: \u0027inputFromPaste\u0027` which we can use for logging.\n\nThe test is removed as triggering paste behavior with a real clipboard is explicitly not permitted by the spec and just dispatching paste event won\u0027t affect the input content. Also I don\u0027t think we need to test that `contenteditable\u003d\"plaintext-only\"` work here.",
