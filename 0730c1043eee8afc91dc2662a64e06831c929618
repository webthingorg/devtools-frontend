      "message": "@jackfranklin Hi Jack, could you take a look mainly at if putting a common debouncer here is OK, plus the naming: Debouncer.js is capitalized to be consistent with other files, and we can think of it as a module so it makes sense. The actual function is named `debounce` because I don\u0027t think a utility function should be capitalized. And I avoided creating a `class Debouncer` and instead went for a simple function because I don\u0027t think creating a class for it is necessary, at least for now.",
