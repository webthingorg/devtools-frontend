      "message": "Hey, I just saw this CL passing by. While it is great to get these cleaned up, I would prefer not to land these CLs at the moment. We are still awaiting user feedback and there is a teeny tiny chance that we have to revert. Since we want all tooltips to have the same UX (either native or custom if we were to revert), I don\u0027t think it is a good idea to have the UX of the issues panel to be different.\n\nOnce we are confident that we are not going to revert, I will cleanup the remaining usages. But up to that point, I would prefer to stick to `UI.Tooltip` for now to make sure we remain consistent, regardless of revert or not. WDYT?",
