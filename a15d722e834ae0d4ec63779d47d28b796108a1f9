      "message": "How does \"delete (only) overrides\" work currently? IIUC it only deletes the \"currently active\" overrides. So if you have overrides for both `example.com/foo.html` and `example.com/bar.html`, it would delete only the foo-override if you are on \u0027foo.html\u0027 and only the bar-override if you are on \u0027bar.html\u0027. Does this approach even make sense?",

      "message": "Exactly what you mentioned. The \"delete (only) overrides\" is deleting only the current active overrides.\n\nI did not change much on the logic, except refactoring the code and add in a new condition to delete the `.headers` file as well if it\u0027s active. \n\nFor the logic of determine if the `.headers` file should be removed or not, I use the existing logic of the purple dot. If the file has purple dot (active), I delete it when using select \"delete (only) overrides\".\n\nShould we rename it to \"delete active overrides\" instead or make the dialog message clearer? ðŸ¤”",
