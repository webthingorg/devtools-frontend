      "message": "How does \"delete (only) overrides\" work currently? IIUC it only deletes the \"currently active\" overrides. So if you have overrides for both `example.com/foo.html` and `example.com/bar.html`, it would delete only the foo-override if you are on \u0027foo.html\u0027 and only the bar-override if you are on \u0027bar.html\u0027. Does this approach even make sense?",
