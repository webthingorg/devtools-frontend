Basically TIL that we built a cache for static templates on top of Lit, so I\u0027ll leave the review up to Jack.\n\nSuperficially I assume that this code affects the code path that most components use in DevTools? The only thing I\u0027m worried about is that for render-heavy code we now do more work to calculate the `staticValuesKey` and I have zero intuition if this is (more or less) for free, or if it impacts performance.",
