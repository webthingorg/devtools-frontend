      "message": "I\u0027m wholly unfamiliar with this part of our code. Basically TIL that we built a cache for static templates on top of Lit, so I\u0027ll leave the review up to Jack.\n\nSuperficially I assume that this code affects the code path that most components use in DevTools? The only thing I\u0027m worried about is that for render-heavy code we now do more work to calculate the `staticValuesKey` and I have zero intuition if this is (more or less) for free, or if it impacts performance.",

      "message": "My read of the code is that because we use static tags in the majority of places (the only place we wouldn\u0027t is this CL if it lands), I don\u0027t think there is that much of a perf hit (if any) as the cache key would never change so we still only compute once. @connor is that correct?",
