      "message": "i think we can generalize this a bit to be for any event we want to reveal in the flamechart.. (not just metric events). I\u0027m thinking about layout shift clusters etc...\n\nThis event could be called `EventReferenceClick`  (or EventChosen or something)\nand instead of being a metric type it\u0027s just TraceEventData.\n\nyou can get rid of the one off sidebarMetricClicked method in both files..  cuz in the panels\u0027 event handler you can just do \n\n`this.flameChart.setSelection(TimelineSelection.fromTraceEvent(event));`\n\nholler if that doesn\u0027t make sense.. but... i think it\u0027ll cut your diff down quite a bit.. for even more functionality.",
