      "message": "Sure! I tested this by running the same steps as described in the bug. Before the fix, this would produce an image almost twice as wide as the website. \nWith the fix, I could visually confirm that the rendering of the site in the image matched the rendering of the site in chrome.\nAfter looking at it more closely, I can see that it\u0027s still a few pixels off (line wrapping doesn\u0027t occur in exactly the same locations), but it\u0027s way closer than it used to be.\n\nScreenshots: https://imgur.com/a/vgYD2Ep",

The reason of it can be correlated with the difference in the markup, and can be cause by the wrong param `scale: 1` of the `clip`.",
