      "message": "we saw recently that maps that grow large can become slow when adding new data to them (in https://crrev.com/c/5001006 we saw a 10x improvement in the time it took to process all events by not adding them to a map). I wonder if this could also get slow on large traces/cpu profiles, since we are adding a registry for every flame chart entry.\n\nIf it does indeed get slow, a workaround for the expensive category query could be using the `getEventStyle().category` helper instead of  `TimelineUIUtils.eventStyle().category;`. We did this on https://crrev.com/c/5003863 and saw some improvement (not dramatic but significant :)).",
