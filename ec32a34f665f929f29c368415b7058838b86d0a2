      "message": "The overall structure and how i18n is integrated in to the module system looks good to me.\n\nI defer to Paul how the individual locale files should be bundled and in which gni/gn file to put that logic, so please wait for Pauls (or Tims) +1 as well :)\n\nThanks for slogging through here! Wrangling the build system can be frustrating at the moment, but this will be better in the future!",

      "message": "Hey, so I think mostly this implementation LGTM. What I\u0027m less comfortable with is the build-time dependency on transpiling via Rollup, which is inconsistent with the rest of our infrastructure. With any other third party dep we check in the compiled/transpiled assets and don\u0027t change them at build (in fact we copy them via devtools_pre_built over to gen or resources/inspector). \nI think we should remove the Rollup pass that converts from CJS to import statements, and have that as part of rolling the dependency in.",
