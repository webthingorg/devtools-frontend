Wrangling the build system can be frustrating at the moment, but this will be better in the future!",

      "message": "Hey, so I think mostly this implementation LGTM. What I\u0027m less comfortable with is the build-time dependency on transpiling via Rollup, which is inconsistent with the rest of our infrastructure. With any other third party dep we check in the compiled/transpiled assets and don\u0027t change them at build (in fact we copy them via devtools_pre_built over to gen or resources/inspector). \nI think we should remove the Rollup pass that converts from CJS to import statements, and have that as part of rolling the dependency in.",
