So because it seemed quite foreign to me, I took the liberty to remove it. I\u0027ve not seen it often in chromium either, actually this is the first time, so I was assuming that removing it wouldn\u0027t go against some habit that people have here.\nThat said, since I\u0027ve never used it myself, I hope removing it the way I did isn\u0027t changing the logic of this piece of code. Not that I can tell, but I\u0027m not 100% sure.",
