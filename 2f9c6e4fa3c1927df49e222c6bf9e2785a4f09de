As a follow-up, the upstream ClientVariationsParser.js could be changed to ClientVariations.js which would include both the parser and the formatter, and then we could just consume that in DevTools. The logic to create the text output is separate from the creation of the HTML elements (it already is, even in this current CL) so that is not a problem. Is this something your team wants to take on? cc Ilya",

I fully agree with your rationale.\n\nSince these strings are user-visible, we should use active voice and try to keep them short per the Chrome UX guidelines (https://carbon.googleplex.com/chrome-ux/pages/introduction), however, so I\u0027d rather update the upstream strings to match instead of vice versa.
