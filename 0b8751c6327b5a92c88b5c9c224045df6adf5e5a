      "message": "Even if we pass setting as a string, settings are global, so anyone could get it via `createLocalSetting`. And yes, that would make testing harder as we need to reset the settings in the global test helper.\n\nBoth are not ideal, but I usually prefer the solution that does not require accessing global state. So in this case `AutocompleteHistory` is slightly easier to reason about if we pass the setting directly.",
