I am a bit surprised that this works tbh, which means we might be missing a detail about Ninja works. We can keep this for now, but it would be good to know why Ninja decides to build this target, even though nothing depends on it.",

I\u0027m not sure if anything depends on that?\n\nI think this might be how Ninja templates work, when they are depended on by a target all the things inside them are implicitly executed?",
