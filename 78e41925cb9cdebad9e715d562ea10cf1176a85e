You should only use them if you truly need to parameterize something static in the template - ie the value isn\u0027t actually known.\n\nI would be very hesitant to incur the overhead just to not use tag names. We have tools like lit-analyzer that will make sure that the tag names have been imported and are correct. Please use that to help ensure correctness of templates.",
