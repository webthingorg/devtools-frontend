      "message": "I think this isn\u0027t a great idea.\n\nStatic templates have overhead - in code size, runtime perf, and memory - which is they\u0027re opt-in. You should only use them if you truly need to parameterize something static in the template - ie the value isn\u0027t actually known.\n\nI would be very hesitant to incur the overhead just to not use tag names. We have tools like lit-analyzer that will make sure that the tag names have been imported and are correct. Please use that to help ensure correctness of templates.",

      "message": "To add more detail on the runtime cost, which is probably the most relevant cost:\n\nIn normal lit-html templates the processed template is cached by reference to the JS template strings array. This is very fast and requires no processing on our part. This is important for perf because we need to lookup in this cache for every render of every template.\n\nStatic templates can\u0027t cache by template strings array reference because the static values need to be interpolated before processing. If they change, then a new template needs to be generated. So static templates join the template strings with the static values _on every render_, then use that string as a cache key. Since this string is joined on demand, it might not be interned by the VM and we\u0027ll have new string objects every render, meaning the cache lookup then likely has to do string comparison not reference comparison.\n\nThis definitely slows down rendering, so static templates should only be used when really necessary.",
