      "message": "In this case I would say that it should be in a helper from the get-go, so it would make sense to do it now. In general, everything in an e2e-test must be the \"what\", whereas in the helpers it should be the \"how\". Since this is dom-structure, I consider it \"how\" and thus should live in the helpers.\n\n(Yeah it\u0027s on the todolist to write this down in a guide, as we converge on patterns. The user-metrics test didn\u0027t use the pattern yet so it might make sense to update it now as well to prevent code duplication)",
