The setTimeout-ed error check could easily happen _before_ the test timeout, if the test itself sets a longer one.",

      "message": "I see, that makes sense! But couldn\u0027t it also happen that the test times out a good bit before that 5s? There would be cases where we wouldn\u0027t get an error message on such a timeout then.\n\nI really like the idea of being able to log extra messages on a timeout. waitForFunction takes already a `description` to log extra state but that\u0027s static, we could have a variant that accepts dynamic state info that\u0027s logged on a timeout?",
