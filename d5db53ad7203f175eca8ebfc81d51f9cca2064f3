      "message": "Personally, I think making the input box a harmony-input and using ThemeSupport to inject the correct styles (as opposed to importing inspectorCommonStyles directly) makes the most sense to me.\n\nJust seems odd to me that we\u0027re using a devtools-text-input and then adding extra css to try to style it like a harmony-input.\n\nI understand that the decision to make it a devtools-text-input was due to a previous comment by a Chromium reviewer, but might be worth revisiting this topic with the Chromium reviewer for this CL.\n\nGoing to sign off on this CL, but keeping this comment unresolved for further discussion.",
