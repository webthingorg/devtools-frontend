      "message": "I did some digging into this and ended up very confused. What I found is:\n\n1. If you remove this line, and then manually make of the links have :focus-visible applied (via DevTools), it works, and you see the outline.\n2. But, tabbing to it doesn\u0027t apply the focus, as per the bug report.\n3. I then tried to figure out what part of the highlight stylesheets did the trick and discovered that all we needed was:\n\n```\n.devtools-link:focus-visible {\n  outline-width: unset;\n}\n```\n\nTo fix the issue. I currently have no idea why that fixes the issue. What I\u0027d propose is to land this CL we add that CSS to `protocolHandlersView.css`, and remove the theme support injection of the highlight stylesheets.\n\nAs a follow-up, we should create another stylesheet (much like the text input styles) but for devtools-links, as we use them everywhere. This would contain something like:\n\n```\n.devtools-link {\n  color: var(--color-link);\n  text-decoration: underline;\n  cursor: pointer;\n  padding: 2px 0; /* adjust focus ring size */\n}\n\n.devtools-link:focus-visible {\n  outline-width: unset;\n}\n```\n\nAnd then, for any future code that uses \u003cx-link\u003e, we can get people to adopt this stylesheet rather than duplicate styling again. Would you mind doing that in a follow-up, please? (The creation of this stylesheet + using it here, don\u0027t worry about rolling it out everywhere!).",
