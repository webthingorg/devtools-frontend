      "message": "Could you please double-check that the output from rollup in a release build correctly includes this bundle file? I am assuming it is, but it would be good to double-check.\n\nThe reason this is relevant, is because typically Rollup will not include files if they have the same name as their folder name (in this case `i18n`). However, we do special-casing for our third_party projects in `rollup.config.js` which might be affected by this rename.",

      "message": "Hi Tim,\nOverall I like the change and I was able to build en-XL from scratch with it, so no blockers on the dev side. \n\nMy 2c, the last couple of changes have exposed the  need for a basic test on a localized environment, as some bugs are raised only when ran with en-XL e.g \n\n- 2659459: [Loc] Fixing lookupClosestLocales in i18n.js | https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/devtools/devtools-frontend/+/2659459 \n\nWe could introduce this test at the end of migration (we want to prioritize not overlapping with parallel work) but at this moment my recommendation would be to:\n a) hold this change until migration ends and we can introduce the test OR\n b) introduce a basic test to verify E2E in a localized env (en-XL) as part of this change.\n\nThis would guarantee that Devtools are able to build/load/run locales. Thoughts?",
