      "message": "Could you please double-check that the output from rollup in a release build correctly includes this bundle file? I am assuming it is, but it would be good to double-check.\n\nThe reason this is relevant, is because typically Rollup will not include files if they have the same name as their folder name (in this case `i18n`). However, we do special-casing for our third_party projects in `rollup.config.js` which might be affected by this rename.",
