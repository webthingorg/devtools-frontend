      "message": "- Do we need to set .height as well?\n  \nIf both `height` and `width` are set, then we can run into the problem of the aspect ratio of the displayed images being off (e.g. 2000x1000 natural will be shown as 200x200 due to `max-width` and `max-height` attributes)\n\n\n- Should we use the width and height variables that are being used on line 1086-1087?\n\nI don\u0027t think so. These vars are only used for screenshots and not for the PWA\u0027s icons.\n\n\n- If not, should we do img.width \u003d img.naturalWidth and similar for .naturalHeight instead?\n\nYes, let\u0027s use `naturalWidth` so that the statement actually conveys some meaning.",
