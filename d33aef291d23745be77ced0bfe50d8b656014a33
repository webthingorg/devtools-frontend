      "message": "Currently this CL just aligns to the existing conventions, but I\u0027m curious if you think we should add a presubmit rule or two to help catch these in the future. I\u0027m willing to give it a shot, but am also fine waiting to see if either of these become recurring issues.\n\nFor the naming convention I could see:\n* Requiring *-meta.ts files to follow the {folder}-meta.ts convention\n* Ensuring a {folder}.ts (or .js) file exists for every {folder}-meta.ts file\n\nFor the lazy-loading issue I could see:\n* Disallowing non-type imports from the same module in *-meta.ts files\n  (e.g. failing for any `import ... from \u0027./[path-to-file-under-module]\u0027;`)",
