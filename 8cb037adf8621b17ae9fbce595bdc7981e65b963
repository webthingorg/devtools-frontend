      "message": "Hey Peter, could you take a look at the `ElementsStyleSidebar_test.ts` file that contains the UX tests for the style component. It uses the `basic.html` document as added in the component_docs. The element itself is not integrated, so you can\u0027t locally inspect, but hopefully the general gist of the UX tests should be understandable even without a working example. Let me know if you have any questions.",
