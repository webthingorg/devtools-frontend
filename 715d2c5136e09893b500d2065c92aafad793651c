I can imagine a situation where the warning can be missed by the uploader and people only find out after they ran CQ+2. To reduce the turnaround cycle, if the presubmit will fail on CQ, it should fail locally as well. Therefore, I would say we should always error in this case, unless I am missing a requirement?\n\nNote that `is_committing` is True when you run on CQ, but False on upload.",
