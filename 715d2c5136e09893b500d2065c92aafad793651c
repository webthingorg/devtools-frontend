I can imagine a situation where the warning can be missed by the uploader and people only find out after they ran CQ+2. To reduce the turnaround cycle, if the presubmit will fail on CQ, it should fail locally as well. Therefore, I would say we should always error in this case, unless I am missing a requirement?\n\nNote that `is_committing` is True when you run on CQ, but False on upload.",

The fallback then looks at the last commit message, which isn\u0027t helpful (it often is just \"format\").\n\nNote that the bots will turn red on the CQ already, so a +2 is not required to see the redness.\n\nWe found that this compromise gives us the least friction.",
