      "message": "Hey Benedikt - a while back you responded to my question about WCAG 2.5.8 compliance for Devtools UI [1]. We share your concern that reducing the density of the tools isn\u0027t in the best interest of most of developers and discussed this with accessibility folks at Microsoft. One solution that came up was adding a UI control that allows folks who want a less dense tool to opt-in (setting zoom factor to 125%)\n\nI\u0027m aware that zooming is not in strict compliance with WCAG 2.5.8, but we believe it meets the spirit of the requirement -- allowing developers with fine motor challenges to avoid mis-clicking on elements. I\u0027m also aware that developers can zoom via keyboard shortcut and the command menu, but we don\u0027t think that\u0027s sufficient affordance.\n\n[1] https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/devtools-dev/c/L1LsziSH-n4",

      "message": "Hey Kalon. Thanks for following up here. I can get behind the idea that we need to offer something to people who have a hard time dealing with dense interfaces. TBH I\u0027m not sure the zoom level is the right approach (at the very least I think we need a better string than \"Increase UI element size\"). This definitely needs a conversation with Peter and Danil, and I feel like it\u0027d be better suited to sort this out in an email thread or document. WDYT?",

      "message": "This behavior can already be achieved by simply pressing `crtl +`, can\u0027t it? I know several team members who work with a zoomed in DevTools all the time. Not sure we need an extra setting for it? Is there a functional difference to using `ctrl +`, which is kind of the default shortcut for zooming the UI?",
