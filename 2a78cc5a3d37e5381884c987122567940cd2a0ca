      "message": "I have understood the RangeError issue related to this CL and it is related to the @codemirror/view\u0027s upgrade. Particularly [this commit](https://github.com/codemirror/view/commit/70a9a253df04a57004247b9463198c17832f92f4#diff-306633a4b2416fe4a2c298e7201348ad340e11f3cf64ece4133de41401880f28R307).\n\nI have created a minimal reproduction in crrev.com/c/4543007 but I didn\u0027t have time to fix it yet.\n\nI think we can move forward with bumping up these dependencies first and then bumping up the `@codemirror/view` separately after the issue is fixed. WDYT?",
