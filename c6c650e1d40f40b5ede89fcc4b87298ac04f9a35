      "message": "Hi Wolfgang,\n\nI think I have most of functionality implemented. TreeOutline provides a nice expandable tree structure, but I did not find a place to override the default style. Am I doing things correctly? \n\nScreenShot at current stage: https://drive.google.com/file/d/12Jo0QKKkihB1Tw5GSnkaOl2lNI1doniH/view?usp\u003dsharing",

      "message": "Hi Charlie, great to see the progress with OT support!\n\nI just patched this in locally: Functionality seems good, but I have some UX suggestions:\n\nCould you make the tree span both columns so that it\u0027s now all crowded on the left?\n\nClicking on a node turns the background blue - we probably don\u0027t need that here.\n\nWhat\u0027s the max. number of OT tokens we expect to see on a single document? Maybe we don\u0027t need the tree to be 3 levels deep or maybe we can expand parts of it by default.\n\nI\u0027ll take a closer look next week (Mon is a public holiday here).\n",

      "message": "In most pages that uses OT token, there is only one token. I have done some optimization on the 1 token case. When there is only 1 token associated with the trail, an extra level of showing token status is omitted, normally the tree is 4 levels deep, as stated in the comment: \n\n```\n// The Origin Trial Tree has 4 levels of content:\n// - Origin Trial (has multiple Origin Trial tokens)\n// - Origin Trial Token (has multiple fields)\n// - Fields in Origin Trial Token (has only 1 raw token text field)\n// - Raw Origin Trial Token text (folded because the content is long)\n```\n\nWe can certainly expand the tree by default when there is only 1 token on the page.",
