Am I doing things correctly? \n\nScreenShot at current stage: https://drive.google.com/file/d/12Jo0QKKkihB1Tw5GSnkaOl2lNI1doniH/view?usp\u003dsharing",

      "message": "Hi Charlie, great to see the progress with OT support!\n\nI just patched this in locally: Functionality seems good, but I have some UX suggestions:\n\nCould you make the tree span both columns so that it\u0027s now all crowded on the left?\n\nClicking on a node turns the background blue - we probably don\u0027t need that here.\n\nWhat\u0027s the max. number of OT tokens we expect to see on a single document? Maybe we don\u0027t need the tree to be 3 levels deep or maybe we can expand parts of it by default.\n\nI\u0027ll take a closer look next week (Mon is a public holiday here).\n",
