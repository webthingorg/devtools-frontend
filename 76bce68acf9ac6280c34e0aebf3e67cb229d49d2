I was unsure whether we will break someone if we don\u0027t preserve the old behavior (as described), and my research into build tools like inline-css and style-loader/css-loader is inconclusive: From what I could determine, both *seem* to produce source map positions relative to the start of the style tag, but I\u0027m not sure if I got everything right.",
