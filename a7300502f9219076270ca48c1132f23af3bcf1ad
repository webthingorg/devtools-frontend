      "message": "Thanks, I like the simplicity of this change.\n\nFor this to land we need to make a couple of changes, some of which are discussed on the bug already:\n\n  1) This is third-party code. We can\u0027t just stick the Chromium LICENSE header on top. This needs to go into front_end/third_party with proper license/attribution. As long as the npm package uses something compatible to BSD/Apache, this should be fine.\n  \n  2) We need to fetch this file remotely indeed. I think a good way to do this is trigger the fetch in the background when DevTools starts up and start showing the doc overlay once it\u0027s ready. With a normal connection users shouldn\u0027t notice.\n  \n  3) Given that we\u0027ll fetch remotely, we can\u0027t load a JS file. That would constitute a security issue since we\u0027d fetch + eval code and the trust level is not high enough. As such we\u0027ll probably fetch the JSON + a JSON.parse call.\n  \n  4) The current frontend implementation is a nice prototype but I\u0027d like us to extract the rendering into a tiny Lit component instead of inlining the whole thing. That component is also unit testable :)\n  \nI\u0027ll work on 1-3 in this quarter. If you are interested in implementing 4, you could give it a shot :) I\u0027m not sure if I have time for 1-3 this week anyway but I\u0027d like to get this done in early February at the latest.",

      "message": "As discussed at https://crbug.com/1401107#c3, we need to think about what to do with this file (e.g. similar to locales, load it on-demand instead of bundle it).\n\nThis is originally a https://unpkg.com/browse/@vscode/web-custom-data/data/browsers.css-data.json file from https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vscode/web-custom-data npm package.\n\nI have failed to import the JSON file even after adding the `\"resolveJsonModule\": true` to the `/config/typescript/tsconfig.base.json` file. So I just wrapped the contents of the file into `export const cssData \u003d { ... };` and changed the file extension from *.json to *.js. And temporarily placed it here.\n\nAnd this works. :)",
