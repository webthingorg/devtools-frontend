The whitespace makes the diff a bit more difficult, but as I understand it, this CL mostly removed the problematic selectors, which is what it was supposed to do. There were only these two selectors that I spotted with regards to the keyframes that might need another look. This still LGTM after double-checking these changes are intended.",
