      "message": "I think I found out about the test failure... We missed that `selectRequest` can take an optional `{ clearFilter: boolean; }` parameter and it is `true` by default which clears filters on selection.\n\nSo, we were causing the filters to be cleared on right click and the failing test inside `NetworkLogView.test.ts` was testing it. Since the failure caused the `networkLogView` not to be detached from DOM, it was causing unrelated tests to be failed too. (I\u0027m super glad that the test failed and caught an otherwise a bug we were introducing ðŸ˜Š)\n\nAdding `{ clearFilter: false; }` to the `selectRequest` call here should fix it :)\n\nand as a follow-up, maybe we can update `NetworkLogView.test.ts` to `detach` views on `afterEach` instead of doing it inside the test but we can skip doing it for now.",
