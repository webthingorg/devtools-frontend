      "message": "Rather than including this file here (which is then included as one of the sources in `i18n`), we can manually copy this file for the test infrastructure. So your `test/e2e/i18n/BUILD.gn` would then depend on a separate test-only `i18n_test_locales` action that contains solely the `en-XL.json`.\n\nAs such, when you build the e2e test, the dependency will copy the `en-XL.json` into `gen/front_end/i18n/locales/` so that you can fetch it in the test and it should be passing.",

      "message": "Great, this works locally, thanks for that.\n\nThe next problem is that en-XL.json is generated by collect-strings.js, which only runs during presubmit on the bots, which means en-XL.json isn\u0027t found. Any ideas there?\n\nChecking it in like en-US.json would fix it but not sure if that\u0027s the best way, or whether we should make collect-strings.js run during build? Or write a version which generates en-XL from en-US directly without parsing the whole codebase again.",
