      "message": "I had another attempt at the Mac issue. The stacktrace I got is in `hasNode`. In it, it tries to access `e.children` where `e \u003d this.cursor.tree`. However, `tree` is empty on the object: https://imgur.com/qwpGYlr\n\nIt is a closeTag node apparently, which makes sense, as my cursor is right in front a close tag. However, I am trying to insert an opening tag.\n\nDoes this stacktrace maybe ring any bells? Not sure how best I can help out with debugging this issue.\n\nFWIW I think this is a bug in the `@lezer` package somehow, as it is getting the incorrect information, but that confuses me as it is a simple parser. I will ask a colleague on a Macbook to attempt to reproduce this issue and see if they encounter the same problem.\n\nThis is the full stacktrace with formatted locations:\n\n```\nUncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading \u0027children\u0027)\n    at L.hasNode (codemirror.js:formatted:1201)\n    at N.hasNode (codemirror.js:formatted:1221)\n    at T.startInner (codemirror.js:formatted:1084)\n    at T.advance (codemirror.js:formatted:1050)\n    at codemirror.js:formatted:9419\n    at Gr.withContext (codemirror.js:formatted:9451)\n    at Gr.work (codemirror.js:formatted:9413)\n    at Jr.apply (codemirror.js:formatted:9568)\n    at Rt.update [as updateF] (codemirror.js:formatted:9586)\n    at Array.\u003canonymous\u003e (codemirror.js:formatted:2585)\n```",
