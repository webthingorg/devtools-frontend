      "message": "Maybe it\u0027s worth clarifying that these are the generated screenshots for the remaining platforms? \n\nOn second thought, the workflow in `Generating screenshots on platforms` also applies to when you want to update them (and it might be more simple because you don\u0027t need to generate screenshots locally). Maybe it makes sense to change these two sections\u0027 titles to `Generating new/ Updating existing screenshots ...` and `Generating screenshots locally` or something around those lines. Wdyt?",
