      "message": "Verified that the parallel runners are working as expect on both my resource constrained MacBook as well as the resourceful Linux workstation. On my Linux workstation, I could even run it with `--jobs\u003d32`, but there was little benefit over running with `--jobs\u003d16` (51s vs 56s). It seems like some value between 8 and 16 is currently ideal, given that at that point the time is dominated by 1 slow test.\n\nNote that on my MacBook I am seeing beforeEach hook timeouts, presumably because it was too slow in preparing the e2e-test application. However, I don\u0027t think that is an issue for this feature, as the parallel testrunner is useful for beefy workstations. Therefore, let\u0027s land this!",
