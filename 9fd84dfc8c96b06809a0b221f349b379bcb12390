      "message": "@Jack, FYI, because you made this change with a bunch of node modules, all the lines where you added the space between async and () now fail `git cl format`. The check is skipped when you make node module changes. Now anyone who touches this file will be stuck in infinite presubmit loop where cl format and eslint disagree on these lines and will make changes back and forth until you add a comment like this:\n\n    // TODO: Remove next line once crbug.com/1177242 is solved.\n    // eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/space-before-function-paren",

      "message": "I think that \u0027Note that there is currently a bug in clang-format, so we have to disable the rule in a couple of places.\u0027 (from the CL description linked) is in effect here. However, it was hidden because this particular CL bypassed cl format, so it wasn\u0027t apparent.\n\nThe only fix I know of would be to go back and add these comments similar to those in the linked CL. I\u0027m currently on a branch health rotation and wont have time to add these. But I wanted to raise awareness that this can be hidden when code changes happen at the same time as node_module updates.\n\nOut of curiosity, should we consider moving to just eslint for js/ts files and avoiding these kind of bugs/disagreements altogether?",

      "message": "What confuses me is that we are able to upload CLs successfully, so I am assuming this is a Windows-only problem? Sadly, we are not in a great position to tackle these issues, given that we primarily develop on Linux and Mac. Therefore, you are probably in a better position to tackle this problem.\n\nAs I understand it, the core problem that we need to tackle is that the ESLint rules should be configured such that it doesn\u0027t cause formatting that `clang-format` dislikes. I thought https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/devtools/devtools-frontend/+/2690528 had already done this, but apparently we need to do more.\n\n\u003e should we consider moving to just eslint for js/ts files\n\nESLint doesn\u0027t perform all functions of a formatter (and it shouldn\u0027t) and therefore we should remain using a formatter. Since Chromium uses clang-format as the de facto formatter for JavaScript, DevTools uses clang-format as well.\n\nGiven the above and the fact that this appears to only affect Windows users, do you mind sending us a CL that updates the ESLint configuration such that it would produce output that clang-format is happy with?",
