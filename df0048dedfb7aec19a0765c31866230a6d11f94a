      "message": "Now the button moves as it receives focus. I also don\u0027t think it\u0027s a good idea to put this into `closeButton.css`, since there are other uses of the component, which might not need the padding.\n\nHow about something like `left: 3px` for `.close-button` in the Console Pin CSS?",

      "message": "Thank you for your suggestion. I tried adding `left: 3px;` to the `.close-button` in the Console Pin CSS, but unfortunately, it doesn\u0027t seem to be affecting the button\u0027s position.\n\nI think it\u0027s possible that there are more specific styles elsewhere in the CSS that are overriding the `left` property.\n\nRegarding your concern about adding the style directly to `closeButton.css`, I understand the importance of keeping styles modular. \n\nI have tried to look more into file system but I am not finding the point creating this issue.\n\nI\u0027d appreciate any additional insights you might have on this matter.",
