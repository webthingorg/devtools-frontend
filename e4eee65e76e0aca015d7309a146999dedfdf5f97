      "message": "Fix LGTM, but it would be good to work on unit test coverage next for these functions (also in `devtools_plugin`). At this point, the logic can become quite complicated and it would be good to have a set of edge cases to confirm everything is working as intended.\n\nWe can add new unit tests in `test/unittests/scripts` (new folder) and we have to add the relevant build dependencies to `test/unittests/BUILD.gn`. Additionally, you will need to update `UNIT_TESTS_FOLDERS` in `test/unittests/karma.conf.js` to pick it up. Then, you can run the tests with `autoninja -C out/Default \u0026\u0026 npm run unittest`.\n\nThat said, let\u0027s do that in a follow-up to unblock the builder while we setup these new tests.",
