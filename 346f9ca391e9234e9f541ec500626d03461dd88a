Now it changes back to the original unit upon losing focus from another CSS property, which is definitely not ideal. We should find a better way to fix this.\n\nI\u0027m actually not sure about why we don\u0027t just write changed color unit to the backend. Maybe @mathias knows why?\nAlso @patrick it looks like Firefox also does not write changed color unit to the backend. Maybe there\u0027s benefits to not persist this to the backend?\n\n#2: it sounds like a nice thing to have. Let\u0027s make that in a future CL.",
