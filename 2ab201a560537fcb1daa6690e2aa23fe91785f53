      "message": "Hey both,\n\nPlease would you mind taking a look at this?\n\nI would also ask if possible please that you check this out locally and have a play with it - I have tested it fairly extensively but as this is a big change to window bounds I would love to get some extra eyes on it to see if I have missed any edge cases.\n\nI think this also fixes a couple of bugs where the handles can go off screen too.\n\nAnd finally, look how small the Performance Model is after this! We are really close to having that removed.",
