      "message": "Hi Benedikt, hi Simon,\n\nthis is a CL to make the description text of \u0027WebSocketDestroy\u0027 events and some layout test outputs deterministic by *not* resolving the current location and falling back to the top frame info/function info that is sent along with the event.\n\nThe changed function is creating a \u0027text\u0027 description and is using the current uiLocation that it can find. See more in the CL description.\n\nI think we could alternatively create a live location and actively wait for it, not sure though whether we want to do that (could we maybe not receive a scriptParsed for some?). Let me know what you think!\n\n\n\n",
