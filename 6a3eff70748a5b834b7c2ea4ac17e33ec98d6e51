I imagine that it broke in the timespan between removing the tests in chromium and now.\n\nIf you don\u0027t have any immediate CL candidate in mind, maybe running a automatic bisect could find a culprit (https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git/+/refs/heads/master/docs/testing/web_tests.md#Bisecting-Regressions)",
