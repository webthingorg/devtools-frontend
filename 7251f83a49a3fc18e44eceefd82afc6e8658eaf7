Unfortunately, there are still quite a few panels that do that, but we should not encourage that.\n\nIf `network/utils/utils.js` is not a great place for `imageNameForResourceType`, you could also consider moving it into a separate file, but not sure if that\u0027s worth it.",

      "message": "How about changing `renderItem` to also accept a `wrapperElement`, such that renderItem is responsible for rendering the icon? As is, `renderIcon` is only used by one Provider, and it feels as if we already have a \"general\" function for the provider to render items. In that case, we wouldn\u0027t need to declare the icon specific functions on top of `FilteredListWidget` and keep it more general? WDYT?",
