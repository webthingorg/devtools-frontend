      "message": "How about changing `renderItem` to also accept a `wrapperElement`, such that renderItem is responsible for rendering the icon? As is, `renderIcon` is only used by one Provider, and it feels as if we already have a \"general\" function for the provider to render items. In that case, we wouldn\u0027t need to declare the icon specific functions on top of `FilteredListWidget` and keep it more general? WDYT?",
