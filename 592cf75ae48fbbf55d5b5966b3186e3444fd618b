      "message": "This generally looks good, but a couple comments/requests:\n1) I think this relates to the previous CL on the bug, https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/2289850, it probably makes sense to reference that here, as that CL has the testing for the content of this CL fundamentally (and also maybe expand the CL description a bit?)\n2) I double-checked your code, and it looks as if the field isn\u0027t displayed at all if it\u0027s a non-ad frame, is that correct?  If so, can you provide screenshots of that use case as well?",
