Because this editor is inline between the HTML elements rendered by `ElementsTreeElement`, which are styled with the \u0027old\u0027 styles (not using the CSS variables), and the \u0027new\u0027 styles are very different from those styles (different colors, and simply less colors), the nice property of the editable text looking the same as the surrounding text is broken by this change.",
