      "message": "Addressed the notes.\n\nGoing to spend a bit more time proving this general approach by working on features that may be outside of the scope of this change, and making sure no features that are visible in the HTML editor were dropped.\n\nWe should also definitely get someone who can say something about styling to look at this before it\u0027s merged. Because this editor is inline between the HTML elements rendered by `ElementsTreeElement`, which are styled with the \u0027old\u0027 styles (not using the CSS variables), and the \u0027new\u0027 styles are very different from those styles (different colors, and simply less colors), the nice property of the editable text looking the same as the surrounding text is broken by this change.",

We should at least track it in a bug.\n\nFont family and style: I\u0027m a little bit concerned that the font and the font size is different from the surrounding \"non editable\" text. Is there anything we can do regarding styling here?\n\nBug: When placing the cursor behind an opening bracket \u003c and pressing enter, the new line is indented one indentation level too much. https://i.imgur.com/dtGQoeC.gif",
