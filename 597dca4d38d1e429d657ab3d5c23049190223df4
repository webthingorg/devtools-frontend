Unfortunately, the suggestion filters use 2 different filter widgets, so I had to add a new optional param in a few different places to limit to suggestion builders.\n\nIf we think this change is too risky for 88, I\u0027m ok putting in a revert of the original fix before this one, and only cherry picking the revert to 88.",
