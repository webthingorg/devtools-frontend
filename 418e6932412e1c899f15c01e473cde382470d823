      "message": "Hi everyone,\n\nsorry that I jump on this so late. I had a chat with Sigurd and apparently I didn\u0027t understand the full scope of this.\n\nSome context: we are planning to make the whole filter better in the future. Right now the filter is unintuitive to novice users, while power users are pretty used to how it works right now. I came across several unexpected behaviors by just trying to figure out how the filter actually works.\n\nWe are worried that changing the default filter behavior might confuse long term power users. Let\u0027s move forward with Sigurd\u0027s suggestion for now so you can land this CL successfully.\n\nI want to collect unexpected behaviors in another issue and also do some community outreach to figure out how our users expect the filter to work. Sorry for the back and forth.",

      "message": "Just to clarify again, and please correct me if i\u0027m wrong, what you are suggesting is:\n* `path:` would perform a test on `\u003cpath\u003e/\u003cname\u003e` (old default filtering)\n* default would test on `\u003chost\u003e/\u003cpath\u003e/\u003cname\u003e\u003c...\u003e`, so basically the whole url without the scheme\n\nI think this would improve the current filtering, but it would still not work correctly when users include the scheme in the query string. Looking at the comments in the bug-ticket, it looks like Peter MÃ¼ller agreed though, that filtering should work even when including the scheme?",
