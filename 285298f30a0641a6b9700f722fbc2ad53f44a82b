The new RFH is just restored to the same FrameTreeNode that it used to be the current_render_frame_host for (so it doesn\u0027t move between targets). The problematic scenario is activations (so prerendering/portals) where a RFH moves from one FTN to another (so it effectively moves between two targets). So the way things currently are, the main frame id reported from the main target to clients, changes when we activate a prerendered page. \n \n\u003e - Based on the above, there could be two solutions:\n\u003e   1.

      "message": "Adithya, would it be possible for you to summarize this discussion in your design doc -- perhaps outline the protocol events and invariants that client may assume about target and frame ids in your proposed model during each type of transaction (regular navigation / bfCache navigation / portal activation / activation of pre-rendered frame). I\u0027m mostly concerned with us retaining compatibility for basic navigation scenarios, even if it implies disabling some features by default when DevTools are attached. So perhaps we should have something like this (please correct me if I\u0027m not capturing this correctly):\n\n- for regular navigations, we would be able to retain current protocol, where both the main frame and the target remain the same;\n- BFCache navigations also retain both main frame ids and do not require any target switches (so presumable the cached frames have devtools id duplicate to that of active frames?);\n- Portal activations could probably be treated specially (on the account of them being relatively rare) and produce a new event that would cause frame tree being updated while keeping existing sessions?\n- Allowing pre-rendering with DevTools attached sounds rather impractical to me, as we would have to pick between confusing the user with multiple unrelated targets running concurrently if we attach early or miss the loading entirely.",

      "message": "This looks fine to me for test usage, but feels a bit scary for the prod usage, considering it may never resolve if we pass a wrong id, or if the same is gone as a result of some race. Can we avoid exposing it for general use and instead implement within its only client (Node._childDocumentPromiseForTesting) instead, so that it\u0027s not accidentally used in production code? We may also want to convert the latter into a function, considering it\u0027s becoming non-trivial to compute.",
