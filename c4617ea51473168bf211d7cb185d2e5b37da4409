      "message": "Hey Jack, I took a quick look at some of this CL, but haven\u0027t really dug into everything yet. For context, I spent quite a bit of time last year updating the accessibility, keyboard navigation, and some bugs just generally related to the legacy datagrid. I\u0027ve left a few comments mostly pertaining to the pitfalls I ran into then, and am happy to go into more detail, but basically there were 2 fundamental issues with the legacy grid that were a pain to work around for Screen reader usage and keyboard navigation:\n\n1) Separate Tables for Header row and Data row: this causes all kinds of problems for screen readers. Most SRs have built in support for providing header row/column context when using a built in html table element, but since the header was in a separate table for Datagrid, we had to do all kinds of nasty work arounds involving a hidden header row in the data table and faking labels, etc.\n2) Focus on the grid element instead of Rows: As you probably have realized here, the legacy datagrid works by keeping focus on the div containing the tables, and using CSS to apply focus like characteristics to the selected row. Again, this caused all sorts of headaches for Screen readers, as the expected table/grid navigation pattern is to give focus to the individual rows and use arrow keys to navigate, and the SR could tell from rows focused what data to read out. We had to basically fake all this using a constantly updating hidden label that would update as selection changed, and didn\u0027t always work well.\nAdditionally, having everything wrapped in a div that got focus caused a ton of problems for \"browse\" mode (used to read out contents on the page instead of interact with them), as we couldn\u0027t mark the grid as a \"table\" since it would dump out all the contents at once instead of reading row by row as expected.\n\nI havent looked into everything, but it looks to me like you are currently planning on keeping the above to friction points in the new implementation (separate header and data tables, focus on the whole table). My guess is that all those accessibility hacks would need to be re-written here to maintain the level of accessibility we currently have. However, it might be possible to address those issues without hacks if some time was spent to change the fundamental component during this re-write.\n\nHappy to discuss more if you have questions, and sorry for the very long comment....",

      "message": "Hey Brandon,\n\nThanks for the comment! Firstly to be clear, this was a very much WIP CL that was uploaded to ask for some opinions on something, and it was no where near done. In fact, much behaviour (and a11y) is missing and is currently being worked on. So please don\u0027t take this CL as the way we are going to build the data grid; in fact since I uploaded this it\u0027s changed a lot locally and I just haven\u0027t uploaded it again (because it\u0027s not yet ready for review).\n\nRegarding 1), we are very much not keeping this approach. We\u0027re very keen to have one table and this CL is implemented as such. We dislike the separate tables approach and don\u0027t want to have to hack a11y and other features in that we\u0027ll get \"for free\".\n\n2) Focus is something I barely have looked at other than implementing the bare minimum to start figuring out how best to do it. Appreciate your pointers here and we\u0027re keen again to embrace the browser and the a11y tools built-in. \n\nWe definitely want to improve the a11y of the data-grid, that\u0027s one of the main motivations behind rebuilding it, and generally on DevTools in the past six months our approach has been to let the platform do the work when possible, and lose all the horrid hacks that exist in the codebase, so that\u0027s the direction we\u0027re taking.\n\nI\u0027m going to mark this CL as abandoned as it\u0027s so far out from where we\u0027re at now and where it\u0027ll be when it\u0027s ready for review, but I\u0027m happy to add you as a reviewer when that CL is up so you can take a look and happy to chat further. Thanks again for your comment üëç",

      "message": "This question came up with the first round of A11y work with the legacy datagrid. Pavel\u0027s preference was that the first row wasn\u0027t selected by default, as there were cases where actually selecting  an item in the Memory or Performance grids would trigger a bunch of calculations that didn\u0027t make sense to always do unless the user really wanted to see the data (instead of just tabbing through the devtools, for instance). The compromise we came up with was not selecting the first row by default, and instead waiting until the user clicks a row or presses arrow up/down to select the first/last row. Network tool is a good example of this. We also provided the opportunity to allow select by default if desired, and some of the tables in the performance tool do this.",
