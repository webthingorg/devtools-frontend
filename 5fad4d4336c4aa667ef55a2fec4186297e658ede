      "message": "This patchset seems big, but it\u0027s really not. Let me list the changes:\n\n- I had forgotten to update the bundle files max sizes. This is now fixed.\n- Discussing we Peter, we realized we wanted a slightly darker default line color and white text. this is done.\n- Based on this new color, I updated a bunch of overlay debug files.\n- I also fixed one of the debug files to show number labels (we refactored line number offsets into positions a while back, but had never updated the debug files, so at least now one of them is done)\n\n",
