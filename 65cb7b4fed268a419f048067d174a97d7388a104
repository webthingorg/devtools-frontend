      "message": "Test looks good to me! AFAIU our coverage for this panel is not great so it might be cool to think about increasing it in the future. WDYT?\n\nFor this change, I think it would have been good to have a test that tests: adding top layer elements for the iframes work.\n\nThough it seems like it is quite cumbersome to add tests for this panel and this probably doesn\u0027t worth the effort. Sooo, I think we can submit this CL and move on for now and we can discuss our overall testing strategy in the meantime.",
