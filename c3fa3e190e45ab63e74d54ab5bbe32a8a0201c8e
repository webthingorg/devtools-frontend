      "message": "Hi Paul and Jack,\n\nThis CL introduces \"Advanced filtering capabilities in the Performance tool\" described in:\nhttps://tinyurl.com/4f9v3cp6\n\nWhile coding this I realized that the TreeView used in the BottomUp panel is shared across the other 2 panels next to it: \"Call Tree\" and \nEvent Log\", this means that they will get the goodness from the change for free, but as this was not discussed in the original proposal I can scope the change down only to Bottom-up panel, although I recommend to keep it consistent across the tool ðŸ˜Š (I left a comment on the design doc around this). \n\nThis change also requires a rebaseline on a web_test, which means a 3-way commit is needed. I added more details and set up a CL for this in here:\n\nhttps://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/5005613\n\nPTAL and thank you for the help ðŸ˜Š",
