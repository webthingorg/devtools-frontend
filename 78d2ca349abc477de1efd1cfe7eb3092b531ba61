Perhaps because this is yet unsupported across browsers?\n\nRegardless, I can\u0027t estimate how much work it would be to please the type system in this situation in a future-proof way, so using `getAttribute` seems harmless for now.\n\n[0] https://w3c.github.io/aria/#accessibilityroleandproperties-correspondence",
