      "message": "Might this be a problem with the current use of instrumentation breakpoints and inline scripts?\n\nIf the user sets a breakpoint on an inline script, the uiSourceCode has a type of `document`. When restoring the breakpoint we use the DefaultScriptMapping\u0027s script to set the breakpoint. The type will be `script` in that case. I.e. when restoring breakpoints for inline scripts (for instrumentation breakpoints), we won\u0027t find any entries, I think.\n\nHowever, I guess this should be solved after your CL that uses the temporary uiSourceCode within the ResourceMapping.",
