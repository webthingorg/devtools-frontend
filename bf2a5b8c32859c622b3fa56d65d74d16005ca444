      "message": "Not sure if I\u0027m happy with this change, for 2 reasons:\n  1) You still have module level state (or a singleton). It\u0027s just implicit now and harder to spot.\n  2) The test now works for a very subtle reason: We re-create the script before each test, but the state of the weak map leaks from one test into the others (it also leaks into every other unit test)\n\nMiddle ground alternative: Keep the class (with the simplification) but put it as a module constant into NameResolver.
