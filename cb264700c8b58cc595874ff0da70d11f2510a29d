Not sure how important that check is, so IMO we can land this before/without moving that particular check to ESLint.",

If you want, you can also take a shot at this, but I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s as simple as removing that one line or if there are test expectations that require updating as well.\n\nOut of curiosity, are you and Vidal planning to follow up with more cleanups/removals?
