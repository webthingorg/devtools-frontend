I wonder if we can fix this somehow. -- though not super important I think, so we shouldn\u0027t block on this CL.\n* The other comment related to underline behavior below :)",

      "message": "Quick fix:\n\n- Regular double-click edits the popover attribute. We show an underline though, signaling that there is a link hidden.\n- cmd/ctrl + click follows the link.\n\nThat should be inline with other links in the DOM tree. In the DOM tree, you never follow links via click, don\u0027t you? At least I couldn\u0027t find an example.\n\n\u003cbraindump\u003e\n\nI think there is a good solution, but it would require re-working links in general in the DOM tree and Styles tab. So treat this more as a thought experiment than a todo.\n\nCurrent situation:\n\n- src\u003d\"...\" links in the DOM tree show a pointer cursor, but the link actually isn\u0027t clickable. Only Right click \u003e Open in new tab allows you to follow the link.\n- var(--css-variables) in the Styles tab show a pointer cursor and always takes you to the definition. It\u0027s not possible to edit in-place. \n- popovertarget behaves exactly like CSS variables in the Styles tab.\n\nPotential improvement:\n\n- All links are treated as editable text by default, similar to VS Code. You get a text cursor and a regular click let\u0027s you edit the code. They have an underline though signaling that they there is a hyperlink.\n- All links allow you to Cmd/ctrl+click them to follow the hyperlink. Same in VS Code.\n\nI remember we once had this pattern in the Styles tab.\n\nThis way editing and following the popover link would work. Also editing CSS variables would become much nicer for me.\n\n\u003d\u003e But ask Adam! He knows much more about this. Maybe it\u0027s just me who is annoyed by this CSS variable behavior.\n\n\u003c/braindump\u003e",

      "message": "In general, real text links that and make you lose context (open a URL in a new tab, follow an anchor, switch panels) should be marked as links (underline either in default or hover state).\n\nElements that just highlight or select other elements (like the node elements in the Animations panel) are not real hyperlinks - they just highlight something but you are not carried away by the click. Here it\u0027s fine to not treat them as links and have them without an underline.\n\nTo help signaling interactivity for the Animations panel case, you could use the same pattern as in the Layout tab: hovering shows a gray background. Remember that we should only use the \"pointer\" cursor on links (that take you away) but not on buttons, so some indicator would be nice. The gray background of the Layout tab is not an official component yet, but might be something worth exploring in the future.\n\nSo for now:\n\u003d\u003e popovertarget link: underline is fine\n\u003d\u003e node \"links\": no underline is fine",
