      "message": "I think we should be good test-wise. The new color swatch component has unittests here: test\\unittests\\front_end\\inline_editor\\ColorSwatch_test.ts\nThe new var swatch also has unit tests in the present file.\n\nI removed these 2 tests because now CSSVarSwatch does not deal with colors at all, so these tests had no reasons to be here now.\nThe fact that color swatches appear next to var swatches (sometimes) is a result of them being integrated together by the Styles pane, which is why I instead added E2E tests to cover this.",
