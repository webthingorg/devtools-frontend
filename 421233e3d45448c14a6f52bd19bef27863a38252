An order is specified only for some settings that are \"visible\", that is, they appear in the settings screen (all settings with a \"category\" field do), so that they are listed in a desired order. But this is not the case for every setting, in fact, most of the controllers in the settings screen appear in the order in which the corresponding extensions are loaded. There seems to be no obvious reason why some visible settings are sorted and others are not. While migrating, we still might want to manually add an order field to some settings so that appear in the same order as they currently do. This last consideration is discussed in the desing doc.",
