      "message": "As Settings can be hidden and shown, we should record a user action for the panel opening when Settings opens. However, as Settings re-uses the same tabbed pane, opening Settings to the same panel as it was closed on will not trigger a tab selected event. These additions ensure Settings triggers panel open events reliably, and exactly once, every time.",
