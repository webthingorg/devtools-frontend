Read the bug[1] and this previous CL[2] for details and history.\n\nHowever, I want to run a deprecation instead of removing it directly. I added an experiment to allow users to enable it temporarily and provide feedback if there\u0027s any use-case we didn\u0027t catch.\n\n[1]: https://crbug.com/1473681\n[2]: https://crrev.com/c/2626292",
