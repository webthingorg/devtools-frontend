      "message": "Thanks for the question Jack! We are going to re-render, but this is triggered from outside (by set data). The resize event might require to fetch more data, so we send out a resize event to the LinearMemoryInspector, which then will trigger fetching (or no fetch if we have enough data to plot), and re-rendering.\n\nPreviously, we needed to directly re-render, as fetching data could take a long time and one would obviously see the delay.\n\nHowever, I could move back to re-rendering anyway so that it\u0027s in some way \"self-contained\" and doesn\u0027t necessarily require a set data from outside. WDYT?",
