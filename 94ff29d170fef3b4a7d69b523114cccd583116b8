Maybe it is better to split the CL and land the the ignore update at least one day before the addition of the file (to get bots with clean caches).",

We could potentially do a dummy run in the PRESUBMIT.py where we read out the file so that we can reconstruct it. Then we check in that version by removing the gitignore entry and then as a follow-up we do this CL. WDYT?",
