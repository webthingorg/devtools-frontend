      "message": "Hey Jack, it looks like the duplicate keys in the .pak file is affecting more than just loc v2 migration CLs. I was able to repro the issue setting HEAD to http://crrev.com/c/2556689. Logs can be found at: https://gist.github.com/hkal/afeeaca0392f7633e1e4e3e8263b49dc.\n\nI\u0027m still investigating, but I wanted to let the loc folks know.",

      "message": "We found the issue and a fix has landed (https://crrev.com/c/2558341). The issue was that the number of files in the devtools resources pack was limited. There was no explicit error pointing out that we reached the limit so it was a bit hard to track down.\n\nFeel free to reland the original [Loc] CL as-is.",
