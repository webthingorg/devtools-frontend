      "message": "This line has a code smell in the cast. I\u0027m supposing `element` is of type `Element` or `HTMLElement`. Is it possible to use the proper title (where its `title` attribute is initialized) instead?\n\nAlternatively: it looks like the `childrenListElement` property is probably initialized within the `_createOriginGroupElement` function. Perhaps we could have the _createOriginGroupElement function call `setAccessibleName` before it returns? I think this is probably the right thing to do.",
