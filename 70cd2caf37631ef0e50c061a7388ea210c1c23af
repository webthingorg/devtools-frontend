      "message": "We don\u0027t, but I think it\u0027s better to keep `this.render()` here since it maintains consistency with other LitHTML elements (I think it\u0027s recommended by Jack\u0027s doc to always render() in set data()). Also, the cost of calling `render()` is fairly low (about 1/100 of DOM changing the slot content).\n\nWe can certainly use unnamed slot. It has a name now just for future compatibility: at the time of the design we were not sure if Adorner will become complicated and have more slots. I can change it to unnamed later when we have a chance to do a fly-by (possibly for container queries).",
