On Linux + Mac this can only be changed by changing the OS-level setting, not in Chrome itself.\nI think some people will want to override the setting in devtools to keep it in English or even pick a different lang. WDYT?\n\nI added a fake en-GB locale file here so you can test it out if you like.",
