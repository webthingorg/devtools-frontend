      "message": "My understanding is that a throttle is meant to prevent a function from being called more than 1 time per x ms. In my case, I wanted to debounce as I want a slightly different behavior: as long as the function keeps getting called, I\u0027m not executing it, unless a certain amount of time has passed without it being called again.\nThis is so that if a user is quickly checking on and off grids in the layout panel, I\u0027m not recording anything. I\u0027m only recording once interactions settle.\nBut maybe the Throttler class can do these 2 things. I\u0027ll look into how it\u0027s done and switch to it if it supports my use case.",
