We typically don\u0027t use file extensions for matching, as the web doesn\u0027t care about file extensions, but I am not sure what alternatives we have.",

      "message": "Since `isDocumentOrScriptOrStyleSheet()` is used in multiple places, I am wary of adding this check here. Especially as not all `XHR` requests are part of these. Instead, I think we should update `ResourceSourceFrame` (where I am presuming the call to `isDocumentOrScriptOrStyleSheet` is from) to check for `.json` files and then allow for pretty-printing as well. For that, I think you can use the `contentURL()` to check for `.endsWith(\u0027.json\u0027)`.\n\nAdding Benedikt as a double-check for whether that logic is correct.",
