      "message": "LGTM, but note that this does not match exactly what happens in Chromium. charset-free responses get some charset applied to them, and this logic is pretty complex and unintuitive. From https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/issues/10023:\n\n\u003e Note that if UTF-8 is detected, the TLD-affiliated encoding is\n\u003e used instead for intentional misdecoding for the same reason why\n\u003e Chrome doesn\u0027t detect UTF-8: To avoid Web authors starting to\n\u003e depend on this stuff. Hence,\n\u003e https://mathiasbynens.be/demo/missing-meta-charset decodes as\n\u003e windows-1252, since .be is a windows-1252-affiliated TLD.)\n\nStill, I think falling back to utf-8 is better than not falling back at all, so LGTM.",
