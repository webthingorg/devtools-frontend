      "message": "In order to match DrawFrames with their corresponding BeginFrames, this CL uses the following algorithm: \n\n  1. When processing a BeginFrame event of frame id N, add the BeginFrame to queue.\n\n  2. When processing a DroppedFrame event of frame id N, add a BeginFrame of id N to queue if one is not already added, and mark this BeginFrame N as `dropped`.\n\n  3. When processing a DrawFrame event of frame id N, then\n    a. pop all BeginFrames added before BeginFrames N (these are the BeginFrames that never made into the Draw step), and visualize them as dropped frames (red boxes) or continuation of previous frames, whichever is applicable.\n    b. visualize BeginFrame N as a new frame.\n    \nA BeginFrameQueue data structure was added to support these operations.",
