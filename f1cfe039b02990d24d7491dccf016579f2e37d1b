      "message": "lgtm, although you could as well go without a specific method in this case -- having some test logic in front-end is useful in cases where it actually involves some DevTools front-end code, as if the front-end code gets changed, you want to adapt the test in the same CL, without touching downstream test logic. However, since this particular case doesn\u0027t really involve anything front-end specific, doing something like\n\ncontent::ExecuteScriptAndExtractBool(main_web_contents(), \"...\")\n\nwould get you going without blocking on the front-end roll.",
