      "message": "I couldn\u0027t figure out how to save this test in a reasonable way, because the concept of a trace that causes this audit to error (by like, having crappy network trace events that somehow have no data?) is not actually possible ... but I guess I could modify the `file` event array to find that some trace event and mangle it horridly ... (except, rawEvents returns a readonly array because it caches the data loaded from disk)\n\nDoes CDT have a mocking library usable by unit tests? May make this easier to write.\n\nOr, we can delete the test.",
