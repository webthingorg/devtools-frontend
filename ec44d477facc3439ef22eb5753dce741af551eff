      "message": "I recognize that this pattern is not uncommon throughout the devtools, but I think it\u0027s generally considered bad to use a constructor call without assigning it to a value. I\u0027d like to see this refactored to something like \n\n    ForwardedInputEventHandler.createGlobal();\n\nI realize that will introduce an additional function, etc. etc., but then at least it\u0027s clear that the side effect is intended and not a code oops.",

      "message": "I agree with the suggestion in general. I debated doing something like this, but decided not to given this regression has already shipped to stable in Chrome 80. In this case I think we should keep the change as minimal and close to the original code as possible in case we want to pull it into servicing.",
