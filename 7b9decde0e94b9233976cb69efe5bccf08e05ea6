      "message": "can you check in with Ergun on this change please? I know the setting to 0/Infinity is important I think for some of the network panel behaviour.\n\nI know right now this wouldn\u0027t break because breadcrumbs are not turned on, but when they get turned on for everyone I think this CL might cause the network panel to break.
