      "message": "Tests look very good and I loved this idea of defining deprecation at only one place.\n\nI think it might be a bit confusing to trace the cases i.e. what happens when the deprecation is given as `disabled: false` but there is an experiment etc. So, it would be good to have an extensive documentation there explaining the behavior:\n\n* What will change for the setting value and its appearance on settings\n* How does it relate to experiment etc.\n\nIn addition to that, AFAIU from the history, Simon made a lot of changes to settings before maybe it makes sense to ask for a review from him as well.
