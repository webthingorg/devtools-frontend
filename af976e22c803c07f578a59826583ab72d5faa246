      "message": "The only use site where {tabId} was not provided, was in {wasShown}, which passes {initialTab} now making this a dead code path.\n\nNote that the effect stays the same. Should no {initialTab} be passed to the constructor, we set {this._initialTab} to this setting. This works as the Item view is destroyed and recreated every time it\u0027s shown. So the {wasShown} is never called without a corresponding constructor call that also correctly loads the setting.",
