If you have ideas, let me know.\nI know that without it, the test isn\u0027t doing what we think it is. In my case for example, it was passing with and without the fix, because it seems that the assertion was running before all adorners had been generated.",

Waiting for adorners before knowing which ones we want to test is likely to report false positive.\nThat said, maybe I can move this to each test case and wait until the expected number of adorners, with the right state, are displayed.\nI\u0027ll do this.",
