Besides some castings there are a large amount of functional changes and I can\u0027t tell from the CL how they are related or why they are there. Ideally we would split this CL up into smaller parts for easier review but that might not really be possible.\n\nI can rubberstamp if Eric feels comfortable/confident that this CL works as intended.",

The question is, what name do we want to show in the sources tab title/navigator view and what filename do we want to suggest if someone tries to \"Save As\" a source? These are the cases where .nameInternal comes up and it\u0027s not too consequential what we choose here, but my feeling when I wrote this was that if it\u0027s a filename it will look best as just an unencoded filename, but if there are query parameters it\u0027s not going to look like a normal filename in any case and so it might as well look like the url. But I am open to other ideas.",
