I see the previous line saying `SettingsScreen._showSettingsScreen()`, followed by this line which calls into the `self.runtime.sharedInstance` operation. \n\nIs there a reason that `_showSettingsScreen()` can\u0027t be changed to contain the focus implementation? It really feels like an implementation detail that shouldn\u0027t be strictly limited to the ActionDelegate here.",
