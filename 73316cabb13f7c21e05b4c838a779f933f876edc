      "message": "I\u0027m a bit confused by some of the decisions here. I see the previous line saying `SettingsScreen._showSettingsScreen()`, followed by this line which calls into the `self.runtime.sharedInstance` operation. \n\nIs there a reason that `_showSettingsScreen()` can\u0027t be changed to contain the focus implementation? It really feels like an implementation detail that shouldn\u0027t be strictly limited to the ActionDelegate here.",

      "message": "I re-read your CL description.\n\nI think it\u0027d be preferable to parameterize the notion of \"takeFocus\" or something on the `_showSettingsScreen` function. I don\u0027t think putting the actual implementation details of asserting focus here is the right thing to do. Seems to violate encapsulation.",
