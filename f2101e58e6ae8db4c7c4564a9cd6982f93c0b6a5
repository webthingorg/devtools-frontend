      "message": "I think there is a subtle difference between the two, as here the name is static (always `source-tree-file-added`). Now that I think of it, we should probably rename the `UserMetricEvent` to `user-metric-event` and include the type of metric in its detail.\n\nLet\u0027s separate out the discussion on naming conventions in a separate bug? As it impacts the breadcrumbs as well.",

I would like a central place to dispatch events because we can then build tooling around it, and we would need to do things like being composed as well. In any case I would still suggest that even though the name never changes, it\u0027s just a limited form of the wider fireEvent function, i.e. one that always sets the name parameter to the same thing.",

You can genericize CustomEvent, i.e. CustomEvent\u003cnumber\u003e and that will force detail to be a number (or any other type), or you\u0027d cast it on the receiving side to be of the correct shape, but here in your case you should be able to do CustomEvent\u003c{filename: string}\u003e or similar, or better, CustomEvent\u003cstring\u003e and put the fileName as detail. The convention should really be that detail contains the event detail, not that we have different properties each time we fire an event.",
