      "message": "I am wondering if we are suffering from the same issue as the `let` issue before. The output contains a screenshot of the frontend: https://logs.chromium.org/logs/devtools-frontend/buildbucket/cr-buildbucket/8830221776139920561/+/u/E2E_tests/stdout (The line after \"Frontend screenshot (copy the next line and open in the browser)\").\n\nWhen I open that link, it shows that the console has `object?.` written, but it doesn\u0027t show the autocompletion itself. This was the same for when I was debugging the `let` problem. Does that ring any bell?",
