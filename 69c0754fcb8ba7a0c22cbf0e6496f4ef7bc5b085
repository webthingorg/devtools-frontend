      "message": "I\u0027ve tested this and it seems like something is getting broken for editing longhand properties after this change. You can reproduce the error by:\n\n* Having a `padding: 20px` shorthand property\n* Trying to add `padding-left: 12px` property\n\nIn DevTools console, it shows an error that says style is not editable. From initial inspection, I wasn\u0027t able to find how it happens. Though it has something to do with `CSSPropertyPrompt` getting being assigned to wrong property: it gets assigned to one of the longhand expanded ones from the shorthand property.\n\nI was thinking if it can be because of name collision etc. but weirdly when I add a new property `padding-left: 12px` it sometimes tries to update a property with `padding-bottom`.\n\nAFAIU the failed test shows the same issue too :/",
