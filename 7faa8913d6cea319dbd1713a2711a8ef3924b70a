      "message": "Personally, I\u0027d vote against this kind of CL. Even though I love me some type magic but this seems hard to read and even harder to understand for arguably little gain.\n\nI\u0027d advocate to manage our singletons on a different layer:\n\nLets allow each module to declare a list of classes it wants to instantiate only once (in the respective `*-meta.ts` file. Then the module loading code owns instantiation and lifetime. True, constructors wouldn\u0027t probably be private, so TS wouldn\u0027t save against direct instantiation.\nBut (!), the added benefit would be finally proper life-cycle for our singletons, meaning they would be instantiated deterministically in a pre-determined order. E.g. guaranteed settings, experiments and loaded i18n module.\n\nJust my 2 cents. I won\u0027t block though, if the majority feels that the benefits of this approach outweigh the costs.",

      "message": "I\u0027m 50/50 on this change; I think I lead more towards Simon\u0027s view that the overhead and complexity isn\u0027t worth the saving in duplication. It\u0027s unfortunate because were Clang able to deal with it and we didn\u0027t have the TS bug in outputting d.ts files it might become clearer, but for me I\u0027d lean towards not landing this as the complexity outweighs the benefits.\n\nThat said I don\u0027t feel so strongly to block it.",

      "message": "As per our offline conversation, I share Simon and Jack\u0027s concerns; the indirection does feel like cognitive overhead that\u0027s most keenly felt when migrating all singletons. That said, I realise that we can and have hit the situation where migrating each of these instance methods causes issues. In summary, I think we should hold off to see if this comes up again, and if so then we revisit this.",
