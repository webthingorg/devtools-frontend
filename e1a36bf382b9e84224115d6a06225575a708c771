This way, the timeline alone wouldn\u0027t overflow. \n\nA second change is to make the details of a time-bar to span over the columns.",

      "message": "Keyboard accessibility was an issue, which I am working on (currently with or without this PR one can move around with tabs and use space/enter to expand/contract details but arrow keys do not work. So the other PR is adding arrow key support). Not able to click on timing bars we can add to that fix. Or do you prefer moving that fix into this PR; I feel that keeping two PRs sounds about right. Is screen reader not working?",
