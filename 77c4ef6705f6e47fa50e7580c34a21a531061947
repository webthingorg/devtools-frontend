The background is that there is an existing setting, and we want to set it to `true` for everyone. But only once, after that the users are free to switch it to `false` again.",

So the change you\u0027re making here should be enough.\n\nBut if we want to be prudent and want to remove the old setting, I\u0027d add the following migration:\n```\nupdateVersionFrom35To36(): void {\n  Settings.instance().createSetting(\u0027showThirdPartyIssuesEnabled\u0027, true)\n  removeSetting(Settings.instance().createSetting(\u0027showThirdPartyIssues\u0027, true));\n}\n```",
