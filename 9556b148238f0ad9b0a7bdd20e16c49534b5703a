You\u0027ll see other changes in this CL where I change the types of callback functions from (e.g.) `function(?):*` to `function():*` because as far as I can tell `handler` would never be called with any additional arguments, but lots of the callers seem to expect it. \n\nWould be good to get another pair of eyes on this, but I\u0027m pretty confident that handler was never called with extra args and therefore all of the call sites which passed in a callback that did take an argument (which was always optional) were incorrect.",
