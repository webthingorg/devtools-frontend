      "message": "Unified the two unittests as discussed offline. Now, all selectable elements have the `selectable-text` class. \n\nUsing `dblclick` to highlight didn\u0027t work. The current test uses range (a continuous part of a document, independent of any visual representation) to specify a selection (user\u0027s highlighted text). This is potentially different from double-clicking, but it seems like both are governed by the `user-select` css property. ",
