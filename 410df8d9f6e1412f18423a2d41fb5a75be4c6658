      "message": "Hi Wolfgang, please take a look when you have a chance.\n\nThere\u0027s a test that currently fails because of this change, even though I\u0027ve landed a corresponding change to the TestExpectations file to ignore failures of that test. Is anything else necessary to have this test get ignored when testing on `devtools_frontend_linux_blink_light_rel`?\n\nhttps://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/3179486\n\nThank you!",

      "message": "Will take a closer look tomorrow.\n\nRegarding the bot failure, it looks like the test is timing out, not failing, so you\u0027ll need to add `Timeout` to the test expectations.\n\nI am not sure tooltips are a full replacement for console messages. We are usually hesitant to remove console messages except for replacing them with issues (where the user is directed by counter to take a look). Tooltips would be up to the user to discover, or am I missing something here?",
