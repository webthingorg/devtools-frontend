      "message": "Hi Wolfgang, please take a look when you have a chance.\n\nThere\u0027s a test that currently fails because of this change, even though I\u0027ve landed a corresponding change to the TestExpectations file to ignore failures of that test. Is anything else necessary to have this test get ignored when testing on `devtools_frontend_linux_blink_light_rel`?\n\nhttps://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/3179486\n\nThank you!",

      "message": "Will take a closer look tomorrow.\n\nRegarding the bot failure, it looks like the test is timing out, not failing, so you\u0027ll need to add `Timeout` to the test expectations.\n\nI am not sure tooltips are a full replacement for console messages. We are usually hesitant to remove console messages except for replacing them with issues (where the user is directed by counter to take a look). Tooltips would be up to the user to discover, or am I missing something here?",

      "message": "AH, I didn\u0027t realize there was a distinction between \u0027Failure\u0027 and \u0027Timeout\u0027. Thanks for spotting this!\n\nMy initial plan was to remove the existing console warning now and add a DevTools issue once we figured out how to add them from the Chromium Set-Cookie header parsing code (to avoid replicating the size check logic within DevTools). After taking a closer look, though, we can just leverage the new Set-Cookie blocked reason enum we added to easily display an updated warning from DevTools the same way it\u0027s done now. ðŸŽ‰\n\nFrom my testing, the warning message still disappears as described in [1], but hopefully that issue is due to specific behavior of my test site or something.\n\nAnyway, I\u0027ve implemented a corresponding CL [2] on the Chromium side to re-enable the web test and update it to look for the new warning message that this CL introduces.\n\n[1] https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id\u003d1250828\n[2] https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/3189493",
