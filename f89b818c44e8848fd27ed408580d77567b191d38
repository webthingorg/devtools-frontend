      "message": "Yeah, `_CheckNoUncheckedFiles` runs before any localization checks occur[1][2] as a common check. I suspect localization checks aren\u0027t considered \"common\" since they do something different for upload and commit. `_CollectStrings` has to run after the other loc check since that has the logic to clean up strings.\n\nI\u0027m not too familiar with presubmit scripts, but perhaps we can introduce a new class of check (FilesystemChecks?) that run after common and loc? This approach would allow us to have a single place to check for dirty working trees in presubmit and not have to touch the `third_party` scripts and hardcoding a check for `en-US.json`.\n\n[1] https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/master:third_party/devtools-frontend/src/PRESUBMIT.py;l\u003d457?q\u003dcollect-strings\u0026ss\u003dchromium\n[2] https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/master:third_party/devtools-frontend/src/PRESUBMIT.py;l\u003d467?q\u003dcollect-strings\u0026ss\u003dchromium",
