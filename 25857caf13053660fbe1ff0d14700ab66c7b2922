      "message": "I think it would be cool to write tests for:\n* isInGamut() especially for the places we haave just a little bit difference\n* clipToGamut() to cover it\n\nAlso, it seems like the conversion logic changed to return clipped colors. So, it would be cool to add a test for this case too.\n\ni.e. from display-p3 color to RGB and assert that returned RGB is in gamut.\n\n-----\n\nIn addition to that, we need to do powerless component checks after conversions though we can also do that in a separate CL too.",
