      "message": "It\u0027s hard to know for sure why this sometimes happens on MacOS without debugging code for voiceOver. I\u0027ve noticed in this case where shortcut changes are applied, we do an entire refresh of the list in the `update` call with `this.list.refreshAllItems()` which fundamentally removes list elements and adds new ones to the DOM with some potential focus changes along the way. I\u0027m not sure if this disrupts the alert but then again not sure why it would work on windows and not on MacOS.\n\nThat said, I think if we can provide some visual indication of the shortcut changes which in turn offers screen reader enhancements across all platforms that would be quite valuable.",

      "message": "Thanks for clarification. We discussed it with Peter and I think we come to a conclusion that it would be probably not feasible to make all status indications visible whenever the alert does not work, it would be more interesting to fix the alert: are there are any work-arounds to try? for example, save the alert state and call it after the update is done?",

      "message": "Agreed. It\u0027s not feasible to use this strategy in all places when the alert doesn\u0027t work but maybe we can review on a case-by-case basis. \n\nIn terms of workarounds, I tried your suggestion already (only call alert after update is done). I know this approach works on windows but I\u0027ll need your help verifying this on a mac. Let me know if you have access to a mac to test this and i can update the patch",
