      "message": "It\u0027s hard to know for sure why this sometimes happens on MacOS without debugging code for voiceOver. I\u0027ve noticed in this case where shortcut changes are applied, we do an entire refresh of the list in the `update` call with `this.list.refreshAllItems()` which fundamentally removes list elements and adds new ones to the DOM with some potential focus changes along the way. I\u0027m not sure if this disrupts the alert but then again not sure why it would work on windows and not on MacOS.\n\nThat said, I think if we can provide some visual indication of the shortcut changes which in turn offers screen reader enhancements across all platforms that would be quite valuable.",

      "message": "Thanks for clarification. We discussed it with Peter and I think we come to a conclusion that it would be probably not feasible to make all status indications visible whenever the alert does not work, it would be more interesting to fix the alert: are there are any work-arounds to try? for example, save the alert state and call it after the update is done?",
