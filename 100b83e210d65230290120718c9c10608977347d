      "message": "that\u0027s a good point. The reason is we are caching the result of this CDP call, which is done based on a list of node ids. Basically we check if we did a call before to prevent repeating it. But I take your point that we could be better off by caching the result per node id and making the CDP call only for the nodes for which we don\u0027t have a result, that would give us more flexibility. We can do that as a follow up",
