I like how you kept the naming, index behavior, and control flow consistent with the original paper; this makes it easy to see that this implementation matches the original.\n\nIt looks like you\u0027ll need to first land a Blink change to disable the failing tests in http/tests/devtools/profiler/heap-snapshot.js. Any of those tests which still make sense after this change could be re-enabled in a follow-up change.",
