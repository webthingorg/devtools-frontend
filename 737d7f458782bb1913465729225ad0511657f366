See the following e2e-test: https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:third_party/devtools-frontend/src/test/e2e/console/console-autocomplete_test.ts;l\u003d54-56;drc\u003d95ba946d80c1de97db9160c043a08b958b985d2a\n\nIt creates an object, it types `object` and we correctly get the tooltip. Then it hits Escape to remove the tooltip and it writes a dot (e.g. it becomes `object.`). In stable, we get autocompletion for the object properties, but with this patch, no autocompletion exists.\n\nI have done the first few tweaks to the e2e-tests which appears to resolve the vast majority of the e2e-test failures: https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/devtools/devtools-frontend/+/3289309/1..2",

Are we missing this label or is it being overwritten? The editor div does have `aria-label\u003d\"Code editor\"` on it, so maybe that takes precedence?
