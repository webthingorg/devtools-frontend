      "message": "I have tried a lot, but I could not define a type for this function that would work both in Closure and TypeScript. In general, the function wants (as first argument) any class constructor. However, that is typed as `function(new:Whatever, ...?)`. Now, TypeScript dislikes the `?` (which is `unknown`), but if you remove it or change it to `*`, then Closure starts shouting. Would be great to fix it, but I don\u0027t think it is possible unless we refactor this function as a whole.",
