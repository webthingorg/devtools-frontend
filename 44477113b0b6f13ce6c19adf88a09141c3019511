      "message": "Here is a proof of concept. Huge thanks to Mathias for patiently walking me through the build, TypeScript, and module configuration + debugging.\n\nIn this proof of concept, the file ClientVariationsParser.js would be expected to be fetched from the Chromium repo; everything else is meant to live in the devtools_frontend repo. I\u0027m not sure whether the current code organization/structure is what we ultimately want, but it seems like it\u0027s at least a step in the right direction.\n\nWhat are the next steps from this point?",

      "message": "LGTM!\n\nFor next steps, I think we\u0027d want to:\n\n1. Land the Chromium CL\n2. Land the devtools-frontend CL (this one)\n3. Patch roll_deps.py to handle this new file (doing this as a follow-up CL seems fine)\n4. Add the new functionality to the DevTools UI\n\nIlya, do you want to wrap up #1 and #2? I can then tackle #3 and #4. WDYT?",
