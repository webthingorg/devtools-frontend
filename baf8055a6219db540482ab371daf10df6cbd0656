      "message": "I think implementation wise it looks good, I have some UX observations and two bugs as comment :)\n\nIt seems like there are 2 (maybe unintended) UX changes here:\n1. We now show the rule location in a nested fashion, in other words, the link is shown inside the `style-rule`.\n2. The checkboxes are shown in a nested fashion, in other words, the checkbox is shown after the nesting margin.\n\nI wonder if these are intended. Personally, I think I\u0027d prefer if we keep the previous behavior: rendering the rule location on the top right and the checkboxes in a stable place.\n\nIn addition to that, I think there are two bugs:\n1. For a nested rule, if the enable checkbox is shown already and you click on editing the name, the checkbox jumps to the left.\n2. Clicking on \"add new rule\" button results in an edit area for selector inside the nested rule but there is no nesting on that text area. In addition to that, committing the textarea for the new rule doesn\u0027t add a new rule with a CDP erorr saying \"NotFoundError Cannot insert rule in non-media rule.\" (This exists in stable too)\n\nI think it\u0027d be cool to address these:\n1. Checkbox jumping bug.\n2. The text area for adding new rule either shows up with nesting margin, or, \"add new rule\" doesn\u0027t take current nested rule into account and just creates a rule without nesting.\n3. Discuss whether we want the checkbox inside the \"style rule\" after nesting margin or without nesting margin.\n4. Discuss whether we want the rule location to be shown on the top right of the section as before, or shown in inside the \"style rule\" with nesting (discussing these last two with Peter and/or DevRel folks would be nice).",

      "message": "Hi Ergün, thanks for checking the UX! Yes these two UX updates are intentional:\n1. the link to the rule location is intentionally kept at the same line with the *actual* style rule being applied, because when you click the link, it takes you to this exact style rule, not any of the ancestor rules (because they may be close or far away to this applied rule). Therefore I think it would be better at the same line with this style rule\u0027s header. Better locality 😊\n\n2. The nested checkbox location is also intended, since they are also closer to the declaration being modified. There are two \"directions\" of stability we can go about this: (1) is to keep the checkbox _globally stable_, i.e. always to the very left; (2) is to keep the checkbox _locally_ stable_, i.e. always to the immediate left of the declaration. I chose the (2) because I think when you toggle the checkbox, your focus is primarily on the declaration, and the context switch would be less. Also if you move the checkbox away, there would be a higher chance of clicking the wrong line, since now that we are nesting stuff.\n\nBut it\u0027s just one opinion vs. the other. Let me ask this in the chat to see what other folks think.\n\nFor the two bugs:\n1. let\u0027s resolve that after we have agreements on the UX.\n2. yeah that\u0027s a known issue unfortunately. I\u0027ll fix this separately.",
