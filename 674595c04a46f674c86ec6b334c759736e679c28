      "message": "Thanks for the comment, Ergün!\n\nWhat would you expect to happen in that case? \n\nMy thoughts right now: \n\n1. the radius of the right side should be visible for all or none of them, I think. Otherwise we have different lengths of the blue background for different lines, which I think would look weird. (I.e. showing the rounded edges for the \"Overview\" but not for the long origins.\n\n2. We could \"crop\" with \"...\" for the too long origins, and show the round edges for all of them. I\u0027m not sure whether this looks nice, but I think I could see that happen.\n\nPeter is not available, so I cannot check right now with him (he\u0027s OOO for 3 weeks), but I could potentially update this as a follow up.",

It seems they don\u0027t get to that point (or maybe there are more instances of this navigation bar that I\u0027m not aware of/could find), since their reactive behavior is to not show the sidebar if the width is too short.\n\nMaybe option 2 would be the way to go then? Or maybe you have a different suggestion? Let me know what you think!",
