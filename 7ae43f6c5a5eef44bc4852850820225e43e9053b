Proposed commit message:\n\nRevert promise rejection behavior in CDP error handling\n\nIn https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/devtools/devtools-frontend/+/1934208 the\nbehavior for handling errors emitted by CDP was changed. It changes the implementation\nof `InspectorBackend.js` to reject on errors rather than resolving with `null`.\n\nHowever, the majority of existing callsides of the CDP invocations can not handle\npromise rejections, which can lead to a broken UI. One example of a user report is\nhttps://crbug.com/1063012 where it broken logging to the console.\n\nSince there are likely other usages we are unaware of, that use the InspectorBackend\nexpecting `null` on a CDP error, we should revert back to the original behavior.\n\nIn the future, we will be using proper promise rejections once we can design a\ngradual migration strategy for the codebase.\n\nBug: chromium:1077892",
