      "message": "Looks great! Two questions inline.\n\nAs for testing, I\u0027d say:\nCover the component (with successful and unsuccessful parameter matches),\nCover the processColorMix handler if possible,\nCover the event -\u003e dispatch event hack if it\u0027s possible to test the behavior here (and not the fact that events are dispatched). This is to make sure the hack doesn\u0027t stop working and that the future fix retains behavior.",
