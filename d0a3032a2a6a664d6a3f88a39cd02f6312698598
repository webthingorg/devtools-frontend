I think we can always fix the binary permissions, especially as we already had similar code that was fixing permissions for the Chrome binary itself. E.g. I would prefer that we perform all steps on all platforms for everyone, so that we can spot issues earlier and make sure that everyone has the same deterministic setup.",

There is one on Mac, but it\u0027s already covered by the recursion into the bundle (see the comment in the fixer code).\n\nSo how about instead of the extra flag, I just check whether the `crashpad_handler` binary exists next to the chrome binary and then always chmod it? That would still only affect Linux, but we could avoid the flag.",
