      "message": "Please donâ€™t make fun of me for this ðŸ˜„ butâ€¦ this is technically a regression. Chrome UI strings (incl. strings used in DevTools) must follow go/punctuation-standards, including proper use of curly quotes and apostrophes. From the context of this CL, I gather that this was done to avoid having to deal with escaping for non-ASCII characters â€” but the good news is, I think we can fix all that, and even remove the need for custom escaping logic!\n\nCL: https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/devtools/devtools-frontend/+/4402896\n\nOnce this goes in, we should be able to restore the proper punctuation marks here without issues.",
