      "message": "I was gonna ask to include a comment here explaining some of the specific ranges, and as I was drafting it, I realized we can simplify this further. First, here’s the draft I wrote:\n\n```\nThese regular expressions match:\n- non-printable ASCII, i.e. ASCII (U+0000 – U+007F) except for U+0020 – U+007E\n- C1 controls (U+0080 – U+009F)\n- lone surrogates (U+D800 – U+DFFF)\n- specific patterns for script-in-HTML support\n```\n\nThen I realized that the first and second list items together (i.e. `\\0-\\x1F\\x7F-\\x9F` form the full set of Control characters. So, we could simplify both RegExps by replacing this part of the pattern:\n\n    [\\0-\\x1F\\x7F-\\x9F]\n\nwith\n\n    \\p{Control}\n    \n…and similarly, we can replace\n\n    [\\uD800-\\uDFFF]\n    \nwith\n\n    \\p{Surrogate}\n    \nCombined, this removes the need for adding the comment in the first place, since the pattern then becomes fairly readable and self-documenting. WDYT?",
