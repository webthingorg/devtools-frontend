      "message": "The mock can handle the script, but per the internal chat, it seems that it does not mock away all of the require machinery. It seems to still have the side-effect of loading the corresponding sourcemap. Could you either mock all of the machinery related to loading these WASM files or update the test to explicitly listen for the loading of these files to be finished? That should hopefully prevent this test from becoming flaky.",

The fact that that\u0027s happening is a bug, so this testcase actually should contain assertions catching that case.\n\nListening for events flying in the frontend is certainly a way to do it.

I have found it quite tricky to find workable selectors. For example the navpane selector has the \u0027 div.vbox\u0027 on the end because that node has no interesting markers to select with, but if you drop this and select its parent instead, the next selector that searches the shadow dom for the tree outline fails.",
