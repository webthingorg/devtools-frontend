      "message": "Hey hey, I think there are two places here that is concerned with parsing:\n* `StylesSidebarPropertyRenderer` where they parse a whole value to get the swatchable bits from the text.\n* `parseCSSVariableNameAndFallback` where it tries to extract variable name and fallback from `var()` expression.\n\nI think changing the first one requires a bit more thinking and I believe that trying to move there to CSS parser would be a better approach.\n\nFor the second one, I have tried it just now and hit a roadblock: variable names with escaped characters are not getting tokenized properly. Created a bug in `@lezer/css` repo for that: https://github.com/lezer-parser/css/issues/9\n\nI think, for now, we can move forward with the current state of the CL and then update the 2nd case to use parser in a separate CL; WDYT?",
