      "message": "(last bits of nits ðŸ˜‚): Since `IdleCallbackManager` is a pretty isolated utility, why do we need a real connection here?\n\nIf it is because we need to import `Elements` panel without any error, instead of exporting `IdleCallbackManager` on the `Elements.StylesSidebarPane.IdleCallbackManager` can we put it in a new module like `ColorSwatchPopoverIcon` and export it from the `elements.ts`?\n\nThank you!
