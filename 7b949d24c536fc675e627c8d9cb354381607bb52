I tried using JSFormatter originally, (which TBH I\u0027m not sure how that ends up with syntax highlighting and code folding either) but since JSON is not valid JS on it\u0027s own (no expression) that didn\u0027t work. \n\nIn any case, this is at least better than before, but I\u0027d love to see how I could add highlighting and folding of the JSON if possible!",
