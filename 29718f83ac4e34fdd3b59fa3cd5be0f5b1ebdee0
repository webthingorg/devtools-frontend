      "message": "The problem then is that the suggest box still appears and might still be present even after \u0027;\u0027 is typed because it disappears asynchronously. You can even repro this if you type \u0027x;\u0027 followed by Enter really quickly on the console. The result is \u0027xx\u0027 in the console - After you type \u0027;\u0027, the suggest box is still up, so hitting enter selects the first entry (autocomplete to \u0027x\u0027). After that I guess the auto-complete handler knows to delete 1 char and replace it with the autocomplete so you get \u0027xx\u0027.",

      "message": "The typeIntoConsole helper waits until the grey completion text is gone, and that was sufficient to eliminate the asynchronous completion problems I was having. If the suggest box can outlive the suggest text then maybe we should factor out a typeAndClearAutocomplete helper from this (in a future cl).",
