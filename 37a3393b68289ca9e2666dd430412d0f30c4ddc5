      "message": "You\u0027re right, yes. Changed accordingly.\n\nMy original approach was to create and enable a 2nd model as soon as a prerender is happening in the background. Such that when the user uses the scope switcher, DevTools is already able to display the background page\u0027s layers. When this did not work, due to the layers info for the background page being not available until it\u0027s no longer in the background, I just minimally changed the code to switch models on scope change. I missed that the same end result could be achieved (with minimal changes compared to the original code) by simply observing only scoped targets.",
