      "message": "I think what Jayson is showing here is that we reflected this specific implementation diff in Edge.\n\nIn short: there is a potential privacy problem by including actual source code in the trace. Consider an application in which we make a JSONP call to retrieve user data. (I know JSONP isn\u0027t in style anymore :D ) This would be realized as a script; and while it\u0027s theoretically feasible to compute a matching hash, it\u0027s expensive and an unbounded problem.\n\nAs a result, in Edge, we ensured that we always separated the \"Include script sources in enhanced traces\" feature, and that it was off by default.",
