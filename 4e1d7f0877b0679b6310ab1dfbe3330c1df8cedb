Things i dislike:\n\n* state is shared now between (target,frontend,browser) in puppeteeer-state.ts and frontendTab/targetTab in hooks.ts\n* target/frontend need to be updated in-between tests. This is kind of unavoidable though.\n\nThings I like:\n\n* Old target/frontend tabs are guaranteed to be closed as this is the bottle-neck here to make them available for tests.",
