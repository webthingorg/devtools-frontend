      "message": "I was hoping for suggestions how to better solve this. Things i dislike:\n\n* state is shared now between (target,frontend,browser) in puppeteeer-state.ts and frontendTab/targetTab in hooks.ts\n* target/frontend need to be updated in-between tests. This is kind of unavoidable though.\n\nThings I like:\n\n* Old target/frontend tabs are guaranteed to be closed as this is the bottle-neck here to make them available for tests.",

I do think there\u0027s some state mix-up across hooks.ts/puppeteer-state.ts, but I\u0027m not sure that\u0027s easily fixed in this CL, so I\u0027d propose landing this, making sure it\u0027s stable and then considering some architectural changes if we think it\u0027s worthwhile.",
