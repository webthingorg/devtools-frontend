Is it possible that this will remain in the DOM across multiple subsequent calls?\n\nIf it isn\u0027t (just not sure because I haven\u0027t dug into the actual implementation of the memory tool), then consider this signed off. If it does stay up across calls, then we\u0027ll probably need to figure out a better option.",
