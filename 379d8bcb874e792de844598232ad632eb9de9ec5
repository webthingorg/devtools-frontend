      "message": "I\u0027m not sure that waiting for this element multiple times makes sense. An ID should only appear once in a given tree. Is it possible that this will remain in the DOM across multiple subsequent calls?\n\nIf it isn\u0027t (just not sure because I haven\u0027t dug into the actual implementation of the memory tool), then consider this signed off. If it does stay up across calls, then we\u0027ll probably need to figure out a better option.",

I can imagine that the snapshot creation would fail, but the `waitFor` assertions in the helper would not catch that.\n\nOne option would be to gather some minimal relevant data from the page and assert that it is correct.
