Please let me know if anything can be done on my end to help.  The only error that I saw with the presubmit checks was that I am not in AUTHORS yet, however that is being taken care of on a previous patch that I recently submitted.",

      "message": "Going back over this CL, we could instead write out a function on each panel of sources so that when we focus in on them instead it runs the clear function potentially, however I think this solution is easier and everything functions how it should already.  Just a thought on a different solution that I have been playing with.",
