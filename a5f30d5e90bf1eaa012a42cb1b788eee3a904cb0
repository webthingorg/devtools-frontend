      "message": "The CL looks good to me but I made the following tweaks:\n\n1. Removed the type parameter of the `TimelineSelection` class: I noted this added extra complexity by having to define a `TimelineSelectionType` on top of the `TimelineSelection` class. The definition of this type also resulted a bit too long with the unions of the different versions of the `TimelineSelection` class. Instead, in places where you added checks for the type of a `TimelineSelection` instance, I checked for the type of the `object`, which achieves the type safety we are looking for and in my opinion simplifies the code a bit. We can revert this decision if you prefer so :).\n\n2. Added a unit test for the eventTitle function by passing an interaction event.",
