      "message": "Since you\u0027re in async context already anyway, this doesn\u0027t make a lot of sense. You should could achieve the same via\n\n    try {\n      const widget \u003d await this.widget();\n      widget.ownerViewDisposed();\n    }\n    catch (e) {\n      console.error(e);\n    }\n\nThere\u0027s not really any reason to create an IIFE that itself is async within an async function, unless you want to allow the IIFE to run in parallel. However, that change doesn\u0027t seem relevant to what you did or how you\u0027ve positioned the change in the description.",
