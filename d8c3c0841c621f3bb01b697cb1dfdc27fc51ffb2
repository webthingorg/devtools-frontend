      "message": "Thanks all!\n\nI tested now all CLs together with the new e2e tests and found two smaller issues.\n\nThe fix here is in the delta: https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/devtools/devtools-frontend/+/2328862/23..24\n\nThere\u0027s also a fix lined up in V8: https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/v8/v8/+/2416492\n\nWith those fixes all tests pass again. I think we can land the code now. It will only be enabled by landing the Blink CL (which requires the V8 fix).",
