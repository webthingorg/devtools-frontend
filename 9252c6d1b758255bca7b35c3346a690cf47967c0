      "message": "Hmm, per the note at [1], adding \"purpose\": [maskable\", \"any\"] is almost always *not* what you want to do, since using a \"maskable\" icon as an \"any\" icon is going to look pretty bad if maskable isn\u0027t supported. I\u0027m a bit concerned that PWAs with only maskable icons will simply add \"any\" as a purpose and it\u0027ll look bad on non-maskable supporting platforms - we should probably provide more specific advice for that case.\n\nCan we provide a platform specific string here? The current one suffices for Android (and soon) Chrome OS, but W/M/L should perhaps be something like:\n\nand the sizes attribute must be set, and the purpose attribute, if set, must include \u0026quot;any\u0026quot and should not include \u0026quot;any\u0026quot;.\n\n1. https://web.dev/maskable-icon/#are-my-current-icons-ready",

      "message": "Wouldn\u0027t it be a bit weird to have devtools recommend different things on different platforms? IMO we should recommend one thing that works across all (or as many as possible) platforms.\n\nIt feels a bit weird to have an error message that doesn\u0027t quite capture the exact error, but instead makes a best-practice sort of recommendation. I agree it\u0027s a good idea though ðŸ˜„",

Maybe that\u0027s actually the root of the problem: right now, the check is inconsistent, and you get a different result on Android compared to desktop.
