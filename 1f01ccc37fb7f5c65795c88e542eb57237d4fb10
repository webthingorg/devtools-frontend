      "message": "LGTM, but I have to say that the `findSearchResult` helper looks worrisome to me (That\u0027s not on you, it was like this before). I\u0027m I\u0027m understanding this right, even on the happy path it will add 100ms for every search result that wasn\u0027t the element we\u0027re searching for. Conversely it will only wait for 100ms after the next match click, I can totally see that not being enough (corresponds to a single trip of waitForFunction).",
