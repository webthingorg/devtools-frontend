Wondering if you can help understand what I might be doing wrong here?\n\nAlternatively I created another CL with just the deprecation message change that I am interested in which seems to have no build issues if there aren\u0027t problems merging this separately. https://crrev.com/c/4500317\n\nThanks!",
