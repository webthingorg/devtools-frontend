However, currently by default Chrome does not assign a tabindex except for the focused tab which is assigned a \"tabindex\u003d0\" (so other tabbed elements are not focusable via tab).\n\nThis PR follows the current Chrome behavior but allows the other tabs to be focused by voice command by assigning a \"tabindex\u003d-1\". \n\nIn my opinion I would keep the current behavior unless the current behavior is a bug?",

Just to recap - this PR allows the tabs to be clicked via Voice while maintaining the current chrome behavior where only the focused tab can be focusable via keyboard. Example below:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/tTikA5q.gifv\n\nLet me know if you want me to update the PR so that we all other tabs to be focusable via keyboard.",
