      "message": "I agree that `host-context` is a better replacement of the older functions. However, please be aware that Apple has stated they are not going to implement this feature in WebKit: https://github.com/webcomponents/shadycss/issues/74#issuecomment-291350193 Therefore, we have a risk of introducing compatibility issues, where `host-context` might get removed from the spec for lack of cross-browser implementation. I am okay with keeping this for now, but I think we need to actively consider a different solution to this problem. Sadly, I am not aware of any off the top of my head.",
