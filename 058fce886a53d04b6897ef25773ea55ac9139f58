      "message": "Oh actually, great catch, this is totally a typo. I was meaning to have them both as slice(-1)[0] to get the last item. And, no, I\u0027m not aware of any performance difference. The reason I chose this was to make the line less long and easier to digest at first sight (repeating config.positiveColumnNumberOffsets 3 times on the same line was making it really awful, but I\u0027ll come up with something better).",
