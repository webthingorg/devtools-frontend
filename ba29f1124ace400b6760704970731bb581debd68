      "message": "Simon, PTAL. I am not the most familiar with the targets system in DevTools, so it may be that there is a better way to deal with this. It made sense to me to dispose of crashed targets, but I am open to other solutions if you have alternatives that fit better. Thanks!",

      "message": "I\u0027m curious, is this a frontend or backend issue? Do we receive a `detachedFromTarget` event for the crashing target and there is an ordering problem in the frontend? Or don\u0027t we receive  a `detachedFromTarget` event in the first place?\n\nThe CL is mostly fine with me, but we\u0027ll leave some traces of the crashing target in `#childTargetsBySessionId` and `#childTargetsById` that are cleaned up by `detachedFromTarget` normally.",
