      "message": "Note that this line makes it possible to match several scripts that are on the same line. Your change introduces non-determinism by relying on the insertion order in this._scriptsBySourceURL.get(sourceURL), and will return whichever script became known first to DevTools. The previous implementation was crafted to be deterministic (in the sense that it always picks the first script on a line if no column is specified).",
