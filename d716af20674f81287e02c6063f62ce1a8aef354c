      "message": "Drive-by comment: This whole `fieldName` business is very hard to follow. We could improve the situation a bit with TypeScript (as a future follow-up). IIUC then the overall type is something like `keyof HeapSnapshotNode|\u0027!edgeName\u0027|\u0027!edgeDistance\u0027`;\n\nFor `compareEdgeField`, `fieldName` should only be `\u0027!edgeName\u0027|\u0027!edgeDistance\u0027`.\n\nIf we spell this out explicitly then we could also type `getValueForSorting` very strictly, since we could type it as `getValueForSorting(fieldName: \u0027!edgeDistance\u0027)`.\n\nJust an idea. It might make other parts of the code more cumbersome to deal with and actually regress readability, in which case we should refrain from such a refactoring.",

So to make sure I mostly got it:\n\n* Since we now extract a different part of the name (via regex) we don\u0027t need the keyId/nodeId shenanigans from before.\n* We use `!pendingEphemeronEdges.delete` logic to skip the first edge but consider the second one.\n* The code assumes that `match.duplicatedPart` occurs only 2 times, or at least always in pairs?",

      "message": "Yes, that\u0027s right. Thanks for asking! I expect each duplicatedPart to show up exactly twice in a well-formed heap snapshot, so this new implementation seemed a little simpler to me. The duplicatedPart is something like `\"part of key (Array @73573) -\u003e value (CSSStyleSheet @30273) pair in WeakMap (table @64489)\"`, which contains all three IDs involved. One could imagine a graph where the same duplicatedPart shows up four times instead of two, but that would imply that the WeakMap contains two copies of the same (key, value) pair, which should never happen in a Map-style data structure.\n\nRegarding `delete` versus `has`, I think that either would work just fine. I chose `delete` here because I noticed that the variable is named `pendingEphemeronEdges`, and once we\u0027ve found the second matching edge, the edge is no longer \"pending\".",
