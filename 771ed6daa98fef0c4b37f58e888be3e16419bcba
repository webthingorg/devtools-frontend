      "message": "So as far as I can tell, this type was wrong. First of all, because it only specified 1 generic. Second of all, because it wasn\u0027t storing CoverageInfo at all.\n\nThis map is used later with the assumption that it contains numbers as keys and values, so I changed it to that. I have a slight hunch the code is wrong here on line 810, where it should use `info` instead of `stamp`, but I have no clue whether that is actually correct. To, me it seems more logical to do the lookup based on the `info` rather than the `stamp`, but I also don\u0027t know what values the `stamp` could potentially represent. Since if it is a timestamp (my assumption), then I think having `number`s as lookup is not that bad actually, since they tend to be unique.",
