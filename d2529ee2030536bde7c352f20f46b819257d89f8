      "message": "I have also realized one thing, see these steps:\n* Click on the angle icon and open angle editor widget\n* Before closing the angle editor, click on the checkbox on one of the properties to disable.\n\nNow, the disable action doesn\u0027t work because we\u0027ve already set `editing` in parent pane. I\u0027ve seen that the popover is closed but we don\u0027t emit PopoverToggledEvent from `CSSAngle`.\n\nSo, can you also add `@focusout\u003d${this.minify}` to `.css-angle` element. After this, I think we are good to go.\n\nLet me know if you also find any other strange cases :)",
