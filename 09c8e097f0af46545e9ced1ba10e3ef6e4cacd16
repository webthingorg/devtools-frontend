You might need to play around with how to achieve this; you might need to give the container a bottom border and then move its children down a pixel or two so that their active border overlaps it",

It might make it easier to style with the toggle button (which I think needs to be in the same container to make sure the border goes across them all like in Yuin\u0027s mocks)",
