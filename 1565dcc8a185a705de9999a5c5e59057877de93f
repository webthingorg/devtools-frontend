I would support extracting the initiator building logic to a separate place.\n\nHowever, traversing all events is expensive and we want to avoid doing it multiple times, so I suggest we land this as-is and rethink how we can plug in extra logic to the initial tree building, keeping the tree helpers pure and w/o sacrificing performance.",
