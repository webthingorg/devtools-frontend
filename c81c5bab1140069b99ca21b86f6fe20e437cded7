      "message": "Let me know what you think about this one.\n\nThis is the most naive approach: regen all the bridges (regardless of what changed) and compare them. This definitely will not scale effectively but I suspect is fine until we hit 20+ components.\n\nI was also thinking that a smarter take would be:\n\n- look at all the files changed in the CL\n- see if any of them have an _bridge.js version\n- if so, regenerate all bridges affected by the CL\n\nThat would mean less work regenerating, but more work to figure out what files to check. WDYT? ",
