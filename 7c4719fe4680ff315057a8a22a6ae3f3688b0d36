      "message": "LGTM\n\nAt first I was a bit wary of the network panel scenario where we have to use a cast to correctly narrow the type, but I think we should treat that as a one off special case, and not something we want to support moving forward; our expectation is that the supported use case here is that you run all handlers, and anything else we leave up to the user. I think that\u0027s a reasonable trade-off to greatly simplify the types and remove some generics. Thanks!",
