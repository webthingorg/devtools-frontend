      "message": "Hi Jack,\nTried to make this work but it is always returning a 404. The file exists in gen/front_end/i18n/locales so I think it has to do with the way Karma setups the environment. Do you have any pointers on how to do it?\n\nThis also needs to happen as soon as possible (before other modules) otherwise we will continue to see the same messages. Kalon has a CL that could help with the latter but I\u0027m not sure if Karma follows the same initialization pattern.\n\n2544063: [Loc] Move fetching of locale json to `startup` module | https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/devtools/devtools-frontend/+/2544063",
