I know we talked about this before, but I lost the context and wasn\u0027t sure if things have since changed such that this is still required?",

This indeed shouldn\u0027t be in _this_ patch, but it is necessary for the outerHTML editor patch, or the completion popup will be drawn behind the other elements around the editor.\n\nI\u0027ll try to figure out a way to get both selection highlighting and completion drawing to work and submit that as a separate patch, removing it from this patch.",
