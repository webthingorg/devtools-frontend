      "message": "FYI Victor we need to revert this change (from https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/devtools/devtools-frontend/+/3136215), as it is breaking the color rendering in the elements panel. Otherwise, we need to maintain the z-index hack that was used in `elementsTreeOutline.css`, but that breaks the ordering of popup elements such as autocompletion.\n\nI think we will need a different mechanism in the elements panel to implement scrolling, as forcing the colors is probably going to cause more problems than solving it unfortunately. I did try to work with the z-index values a bit, but none of it works and it feels like we add more hacks for it than solving it.\n\nTo solve this in the future, I think we will need to refactor how `.selection.fill` works, which is currently a `position: absolute` element in the panel. This filling then gets `z-index: -1`, which seems wrong on its own as well. However, that is quite a bit of work that I don\u0027t think is worth blocking this CL on.",

      "message": "It seems like we still need this for showing the highlight of the elements panel node: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tJ3y2OtHXV_TZIv8gEJJcQC-rTJFXWVO/view?usp\u003dsharing Without this line, the highlight no longer shows up.\n\nIt\u0027s not 100% clear to me why this change is necessary, given that the CL intends to port the \"Edit breakpoint\" dialog in the sources panel, which afaik never shows up in the elements panel. I know we talked about this before, but I lost the context and wasn\u0027t sure if things have since changed such that this is still required?",

This indeed shouldn\u0027t be in _this_ patch, but it is necessary for the outerHTML editor patch, or the completion popup will be drawn behind the other elements around the editor.\n\nI\u0027ll try to figure out a way to get both selection highlighting and completion drawing to work and submit that as a separate patch, removing it from this patch.",

      "message": "Okay, this was intentional after all, since the z-index problem only became an issue after enabling autocompletion in the new editors, which is one of the effects of this CL.\n\nI\u0027ve updated the patch to also remove the explicit background from `#elements-content`, which seems to be the reason this z-index was necessary, and which doesn\u0027t itself seem to have served a purpose, since this component is already shown over the proper background.",
