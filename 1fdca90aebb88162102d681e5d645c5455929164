      "message": "I know that this is used (maybe among other usages) as a style formatter to try to make a property valid, e.g. if it misses a semicolon or multiple properties are on the same line, etc. I remember Tim once tried to remove this altogether because honestly we don\u0027t need this; the backend, when receiving the styles from the frontend, will parse everything nicely for us.\n\nHowever, I remember that got sort-of reverted by Microsoft folks for reasons I don\u0027t remember. Let me see if I could dig that up. Meanwhile this CL is good to go.",
