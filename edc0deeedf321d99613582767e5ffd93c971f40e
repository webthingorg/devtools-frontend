      "message": "Hi Michael and Chait, \n\nI\u0027m preparing this for upstream review. Please take another look when possible and once I get a sign off, I\u0027ll add an upstream reviewer. \n\nAs mentioned in scrum today, currently there aren\u0027t any unit tests for this because no similar unit tests were found, including in the tests for CSS Overview. There\u0027s also still more work to be done for the telemetry e2e tests, but this will be worked on after it\u0027s up for upstream review. \n\n\nThanks!",
