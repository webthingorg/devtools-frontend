      "message": "Adding Tim and Alex because they were discussing this yesterday.\nTim compared brotli vs. gzip and found brotli is 10x slower for release and saves ~3% more space.\nNot compressing in debug does seem like a reasonable solution, although if we switch back to gzip then we get the benefit for release builds too and the time for debug should only be a few seconds.\nWDYT Tim + Alex?",
