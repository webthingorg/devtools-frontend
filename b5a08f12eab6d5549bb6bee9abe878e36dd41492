The actual CL(https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/devtools/devtools-frontend/+/2027431) is mixed with some refactorings and the actual creation of the Stable console. So how about we update this with an example in the next branch cut? I can crate that future CL and amend the docs accordingly.",
