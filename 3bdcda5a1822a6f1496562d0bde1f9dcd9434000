      "message": "AFAIU with this change we can have the same `index` assigned to different properties. I was thinking this might cause issues but couldn\u0027t find a way to make it error. The reason it currently works for edit is, even though we\u0027re saying the `index` for longhand properties is not at the end, they are placed at the end of the `allPropertiesInternal` array.\n\nCan we continue putting these properties at the end of the array and mark their indexes correctly in the `allPropertiesInternal` array for consistency? (AFAIU it is what we were doing previously -- adding longhand properties to the end of the array with correct index.)\n\nThere might be other errors related to having non-unique index too.\n\n(I didn\u0027t take a look at the failing tests, do you have an idea why do they fail?)",
