So start will behave like flex-start because flex-start is the initial value, so since start isn\u0027t implemented, it defaults to its default value.\nend, however, will not behave as flex-end, since it\u0027s not supported either, so will default to the initial flex-start value.\nDoes that make sense?\n\nSee https://imgur.com/PIPqKVI",
