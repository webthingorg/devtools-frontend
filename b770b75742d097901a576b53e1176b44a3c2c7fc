      "message": "As discussed, this is what the test is doing, i.e. verifying that the next two targets would get names \"#1\" and \"#2\" and not \"#4\" and \"#5\". \n\nOverall this logic is underspecified and I am struggling to write more clear test and I have a feeling that parts of this work by accident (e.g. in theory we would show target CDP ID as a name of frame targets, but this doesn\u0027t seem to happen in practice as this happens only for data: and about URLs and the only traget that could have such URL is a main target, which we special case and call \"Main\")",
