      "message": "Because this method is called by the enviroment helpers, it is expected that several calls will be made with those conditions (having settings registered and not forcing a reset) when running unit tests. I think it would be better if we treated this as a default behaviour (instead of an exception), in which the settings are not reset unless requested explicitly by the tests, just like the environment helpers are currently implemented by reusing a Runtime singleton unless a new instance is requested explicitly.",
