      "message": "A general note: The description is the only thing that a translator will see together with the \"to-be-translated\" string. Translators don\u0027t have a lot of tech background so most of the words in the strings will be unknown to them. They have access to a glossary with \"common\" terms, but those usually don\u0027t contain the highly technical terms we have in DevTools.\n\nTranslating issue descriptions will be doubly tricky, since they convey a lot more information and have a lot more unknown terms than just a label for a button or an input field so its important to write detailed descriptions explaining many of the terms in the translated text.\n\nHere is our official guidance: https://chromium.googlesource.com/devtools/devtools-frontend/+/refs/heads/main/docs/localization/descriptions.md\n\nThere is also additional documentation how to e.g. have untranslated parts of a string (via backticks) or use placeholders.\n\nIt might also be worth it to cross check with other strings whether terms like \"cross-origin\" are translated or not, as to stay consistent within DevTools.\n\nI know this is a lot of work, but if we don\u0027t do it upfront then we either have to handle a lot of questions from translators (and re-answer the questions when the strings slightly change and need re-translation) or we get lower quality translations.",
