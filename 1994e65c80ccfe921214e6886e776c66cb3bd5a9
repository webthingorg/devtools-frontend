      "message": "I think when Big Request Rows is enabled this makes sense as the user can see two priorities.\n\nHowever, the same tool tip shows also when that setting is not enabled and it might be confusing to users to get that extra information in that scenario when they are the same.\n\nI think it\u0027s still worthwhile to show when they are different (it saves you having to enable big request rows to see if it if you don\u0027t want to, and it might help explain why it\u0027s not acting as you thought it should) but less convinced when the same.\n\nBut not 100% against it either...",

I did a quick check for the Size column as it has similar case. https://imgur.com/a/9ibY7hb\n\nIt shows the same message regardless of big and small row, and doesn\u0027t matter if the final and transfer size are the same or not.\n\nMy preference was having something similar but I don\u0027t have strong opinion.",
