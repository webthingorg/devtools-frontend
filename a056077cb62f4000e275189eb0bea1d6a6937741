      "message": "Hi jec@,\n\nFrom the bug, my suggestion of using \"Ctrl + Shift + U\" doesn\u0027t work when the user is focused on editor when a source file is open because in some of the platforms (i.e. ChromeOS) \"Ctrl + Shift + U\" is mapped to entering a unicode character.\n\nI have chosen \"Ctrl + Shift + K\" a bit randomly to move forward with the implementation. Though it might still be a good candidate from the same perspective (it\u0027s close to Y and on the right of Y ðŸ˜…) but I\u0027m not sure.\n\nWDYT, can you suggest a new shortcut?",
