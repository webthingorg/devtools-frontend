      "message": "I think there has been some confusion, there are two distinct event dispatching systems in devtools and in this CL you are inadvertently using a hybrid of both of them.\n\nThe first is the widget system; this uses the bespoke `dispatchEventToListeners` API, and we define those events via this convention you have used here.\n\nThe second is the regular browser event system which we use with custom elements; for that we follow the pattern used for the `RemoveAnnotation` event above, where we define the event as a custom event. There is some documentation on this here: https://github.com/ChromeDevTools/devtools-frontend/blob/main/front_end/ui/components/docs/building-ui-documentation/ComponentEvents.md\n\nIn this instance, because you are dispatching the event from `SidebarSingleNavigation`, you should use the \"browser\" system, and therefore follow the pattern used by `RemoveAnnotation`.",
