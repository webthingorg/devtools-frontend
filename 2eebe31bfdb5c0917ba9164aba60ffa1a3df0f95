      "message": "Hi Kim,\n\nI packaged up changes for the 1st mile-stone. I added two simple sanity-check unit tests, as they were quite easy to add. Though, I couldn\u0027t figure out a way to import the `memoryObjectInfo` inside of the unittest without a \"cross-module import error\" eslint error, so I suppressed it for now. \n\n\nThank you for the review!",
