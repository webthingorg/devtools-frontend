I also tried to add styles using the document but that did not work either as Tim mentioned it is deep in a shadow root somewhere. \n\nIn another CL I will implement the changes we discussed where the styles will be handled in the closest possible UI.Widget with a comment explaining why we have chosen to add them there.",
