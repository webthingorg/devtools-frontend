      "message": "LGTM, with two notes:\n\n- We’ll probably want to wait until the DevTools DEPS has an up-to-date Chromium before landing this (see my comment)\n- Do we need a test? I think for some of the other emulation functionality, we have high-level e2e test that verifies the \u003cselect\u003e’s contents — we could add a few lines there? Given the upstream tests, this seems sufficient.",
