      "message": "Hi Simon,\n\nThis CL Migrates mobile_throttling to Localization V2.\n\nIn this case I splitted the CL in two parts for testing/readability but I plan to check-in only this one (if it gets approved) For this I\u0027ll retarget this branch to master/main so that it gets checked atomically and abandon the linked CL\n\nThe linked CL contains the usual changes we do to any other module, but on runtime there is a race condition between i18n and mobile_throttling, (which manifest as a custom exception on i18n)\n\nThis CL contains a fix for the mentioned issue based on a proposal by Kalon on this thread:\nhttps://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/devtools/devtools-frontend/+/2522640/14/front_end/emulation/SensorsView.js#875\n\nHigh level involves the usage of getters to differ the getLocalizedStrings call. PTAL and feel free to join dicussion on Kalon\u0027s thread.",
