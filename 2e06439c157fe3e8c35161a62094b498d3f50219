      "message": "Any thoughts on using `prefers-color-scheme` here? Right now our OS theming is a bit broken, since dark|light theme detection happens once during initialization[1], so if a customer updates their OS theme setting while DevTools is open they\u0027re forced to reload to have themes respected. We get a decent amount of feedback about this.\n\nHowever, if the CSS media feature was used, DevTools\u0027 webview would re-draw the colors without a user needing to reload.\n\nWe may have to declare the dark theme variables in both the media feature block and here in order to continue supporting the non-system preference cases.\n\n[1] https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/master:third_party/devtools-frontend/src/front_end/theme_support/theme_support_impl.js;l\u003d50?q\u003dthemesupport\u0026ss\u003dchromium",
