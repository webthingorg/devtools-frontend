      "message": "PTAL. To be totally honest I am not sure if this is a good idea or not - is it worth us investing in supporting both types, or are we better off migrating code so that we know the type (e.g. we know layout shifts are always new events now) ?\n\nProbably the second one? So maybe this isn\u0027t useful?",

      "message": "I think that for the single event detailed view, apart from a handful of exceptions, we should be able to tell the source of each event that\u0027s passed to the function. The helper might be useful for these exceptions (f.e. at the moment I can think of timing events which can appear in multiple tracks). It would also be useful if we aren\u0027t sure about an event only coming from one source as we work on the migration.\n\nOn the other hand using this pattern consistently means will be left with more tests that we will have to refactor once we have removed legacy events from a number places.\n\nI think such a helper is useful, but we don\u0027t need to use it for every event.",
