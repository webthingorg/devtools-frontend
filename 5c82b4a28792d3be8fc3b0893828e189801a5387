      "message": "Layering wise it seems a lil bit messy to have cpuprofile specific stuff defined in the loader rather than TimelineModel...but.. I don\u0027t care too strongly.\n\nHowever.. based on my comment on https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/devtools/devtools-frontend/+/4265114 .. I\u0027m wondering if instead.. \n\nWe want to set some bit that we\u0027re handling a cpuprofile (that went through buildTraceProfileFromCpuProfile)... that way we can \n1) keep all the timelinemodelfilter stuff in timelinemodel and \n2) you have a clear this-is-a-cpuprofile bool to check in generateTracingEventsFromCpuProfile to use for the conditional i\u0027m suggesting.\n\nI feel like isCpuProfile is akin to the GenericTrace/InspectorTrace delineation that we also handle mostly in the TimelineModel.",
