As discussed in our email we can update the TreeOutline to make the equality checks better - either by comparing data like you have here or by making each tree node take some string/number that is a unique identifier, kinda like a key function.\n\nRE focus, sounds like a bug in the TreeOutline that needs to be fixed. After first render I guess we should call focus on one of the dom nodes? Probably the first root node?",
