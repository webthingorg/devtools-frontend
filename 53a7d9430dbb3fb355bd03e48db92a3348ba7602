If I add it to the devtools_pre_built(\"i18n\") step it complains about two targets generating the i18n.d.ts file (devtools_pre_built \u0026\u0026 devtools_entrypoint). Any thoughts on how to include it?",

      "message": "Right. We have a conflict here, as `devtools_entrypoint` assumes that it is in the driving seat. Since you manually need to check in the `.d.ts` file, that is not fully appropriate.\n\nWe have 2 options:\n1. Don\u0027t make this a `devtools_entrypoint` and instead force the inclusion into `i18n`. You can see the `rollup.config.js` file to see how we do that for `acorn`. Then you can keep the `devtools_pre_built` as is. Again, you can see `acorn` as an example here.\n2. Keep the `devtools_entrypoint` and make the bundle pass the TypeScript typechecker. Since this is third_party code, I would advise against this, but it is technically possible.",
