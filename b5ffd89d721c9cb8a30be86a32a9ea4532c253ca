      "message": "Let\u0027s align indentation with VS Code, e.g. maintain the current version.\n\nWith respect to the indentation issues I posted: that seems to be the case where we don\u0027t detect the indentation of the current document. E.g. if I explicitly set my indentation to 4 spaces, despite the HTML document being indented with 2 spaces, it uses 4 spaces. I just checked and we currently do the same in stable, so I think it is fine to keep the behavior as-is and disregard my indentation comments.\n\nUnfortunately I still can\u0027t enter the \"\u003c\" character on Mac. Do we still need to fix that bug?\n\nAnd +1 to not letting the chain get too deep.",

I don\u0027t have a dev environment set up on a Mac though—is there a way to \u0027transplant\u0027 my devtools build from Linux to a Chrome that I can run on Mac, without pulling in all those tools, or should I set up the entire environment?",

      "message": "One thought I had: since CodeMirror.next is relatively large (not terribly, but still quit a bit), I wonder if we can lazily load the editor when we need to? E.g. I think we can do the following and avoid the static import:\n\n```\nconst TextEditor \u003d await import(\u0027../../ui/components/text_editor/text_editor.js\u0027);\nconst CodeMirror \u003d await import(\u0027../../third_party/codemirror.next/codemirror.next.js\u0027);\nconst editor \u003d new TextEditor.TextEditor.TextEditor(CodeMirror.EditorState.create({\n```\n\nYou will still need the `TextEditor` import for the type, but then we can change that into `import type * as TextEditor`.\n\nThis is not only nice during the migration, but also saves the user from loading the code until the editor is actually needed, which is a small optimization anyways.",
