      "message": "This actually seems, in a way, like a bigger issue than just about the Developer Tools.\nIf you notice, none of the other user-interface elements of the browser (the toolbar, or the history screen, for example) supports this behavior. While I am in favor of adding accessibility features generally, it makes sense to make this a cross-product behavior rather than only the behavior of a specific browser feature (thus creating an inconsistency).\nWas this discussed with any Chrome user interface lead? Are there Monorail issues for other parts of the browser to get a similar treatment (web user interface history, or the toolbar or any other)?",

      "message": "Hmmm, I was pretty much just focused on the DevTools when I made this change, so I didn\u0027t talk to the Chrome UI folks. We actually went back and forth a bit on whether to make this change internally and ultimately only decided to go forward with the ~half second delay after focusing. \nAs far as I know there aren\u0027t any comparable efforts on the browser side--if you think that the Chrome UI team would be bothered by the inconsistency then maybe we should consider a revert?",
