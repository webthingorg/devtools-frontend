While I am in favor of adding accessibility features generally, it makes sense to make this a cross-product behavior rather than only the behavior of a specific browser feature (thus creating an inconsistency).\nWas this discussed with any Chrome user interface lead? Are there Monorail issues for other parts of the browser to get a similar treatment (web user interface history, or the toolbar or any other)?",
