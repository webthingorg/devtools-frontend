      "message": "Hey all,\n\nWe\u0027re seeing a performance regression in breakpoint setting and we\u0027re suspecting this commit is causing the issue.  I\u0027m seeing a regression of about ~10ms from the lab and also from testing locally.  I\u0027ve also tested by timing the _setBreakpoint call using line/col numbers with and without using getPossibleBreakpoints(), and the run using getPossibleBreakpoints() also runs around 10ms faster.\n\nMy hunch is that retrieving the possible breakpoint locations before passing it into _setBreakpoint is more time efficient than letting _setBreakpoint resolve the breakpoint location itself.\n\nLet me know if this is a change we believe is worth keeping.\n\nThanks,\nMichael L.",
