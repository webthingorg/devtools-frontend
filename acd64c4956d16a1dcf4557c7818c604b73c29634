      "message": "Visual design wise it looks great on dark as well on light mode ðŸ˜Š\n\nSome properties might be mis-categorized:\n- text-size-adjust | \"Other\" -\u003e \"Text\"\n- font-smoothing | \"Other\" -\u003e \"Text\"\n- min-width | \"Other\" -\u003e \"Layout\"\n- tap-highlight-color | \"Other\" -\u003e \"Appearance\"\n\nI know we already talked about it and you probably decided against it. But I would really recommend show the groups initially opened instead of closed. I think the length of the properties panel is still totally manageable. What makes it a little bit frustrating is that the groups are all closed again after DevTools is reopened or the developer switches to a new tab. As a result you are greeted by an essentially empty panel.\n\nI remember we talked about that the developer might want to only open specific groups. That might work if they are remembered across DevTools sessions. Right now I have the feeling that I need to open all of them to understand whats inside (especially with the \"Other\" category).\n\nJust my 2 cents ðŸ˜Š Else it\u0027s really really cool.",

      "message": "I\u0027m not feeling strongly about collapsing by default, and I think you have a good point about them \"need to open all of them to understand whats inside\", which would have negative effects for developers adopting this feature.\n\nFor now Let me expand them by default. We can also iterate more on the designs during the M86 canary coverage, e.g. finding a way to collapse/expand all the groups at once.\n\nThanks for the feedback! I\u0027ll also add the properties you mentioned to their respective categories.",
