      "message": "Thanks for working on this, the changes make sense.\n\nSadly I saw minimal performance improvement on `git cl presubmit --upload --force`: from 19 seconds to 17 seconds. It seems like the other bottlenecks are more severe. However, it might be that your filesystem access is slower by default and therefore these changes have a higher impact on your machine? Therefore it would still make sense to make the changes in this CL, but I think more work is needed ðŸ˜­",

I\u0027m still investigating why the regression happened but nothing that stands out yet. I\u0027ll keep this CL updated with any changes new findings.",

      "message": "Thanks for working on this Vidal! Left a small suggestion. \nAlso I was thinking is it worth for us to look into combining two Loc scan into one? That can potentially speed up the presubmit since we now only run through the files once, but then... it will become a very complex scan that does a lot of checks, so Im not sure if it\u0027s the right thing to do.
