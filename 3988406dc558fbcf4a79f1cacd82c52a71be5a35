      "message": "Hi Jack, hi Alex,\n\nI\u0027ve updated a refactoring in patch 14: basically the logic about pages is moved to the LinearMemoryInspector, and the LinearMemoryViewer is just painting whatever it gets. On a resize event\nit sends along how many bytes it can plot, and the LinearMemoryInspector will store that info in order\nto always send along the correct number of bytes on a re-render. This required also some updates on the tests.\n\nOn another note: the error I\u0027m getting on the linear_memory_inspector-legacy.js file is difficult to debug, and I might need to update (e.g. patchset 15) and re-run on the bots a few times to find this issue. I\u0027ll remove you from the attention set.",
