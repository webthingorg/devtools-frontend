      "message": "I don\u0027t understand this assertion \"this triggers logic to disable the start button\". Your `toggleRecord()` function is synchronous; on the same turn of the crank, you unconditionally restore focus. \n\nI don\u0027t really understand why you need to use a focus restorer at all. My understanding of a focus restorer is that it\u0027s supposed to restore focus after some intervening asynchronous UI operation (such as a modal dialog popup). It seems apropos to me to just call `this.element.focus()` at the end, unconditionally.\n\nYour use of `ElementFocusRestorer` initially had me looking at the behavior following stopping profiling. But re-reading your commit message, it looks to me instead that \"something under the hood is triggering a UI change, thereby removing focus, so I\u0027m going to restore focus once I\u0027m done.\" I\u0027d be on board if it was asynchronous, but it looks like the wrong approach for a function that doesn\u0027t use `await`.",
