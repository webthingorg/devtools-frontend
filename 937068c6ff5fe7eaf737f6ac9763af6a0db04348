I didn\u0027t know this existed :)\n\nthough, the UI there looks a bit weird now compared with other settings tabs considering that the contents of the other tabs arranged in a way that doesn\u0027t require horizontal scrolling.\n\nI wonder if it makes sense to find a way to render this tab as well in a more vertical fashion.
