      "message": "I find this a bit confusing. It seems that the \"descriptors\" array and its items can be loggables.\n\nIn here, we\u0027re calling `registerLoggable` with an array of descriptors where, then I expect the `descriptors` array to be registered as a loggable however in here this method registers its items as loggables.\n\nCan we rename this function to `registerChildLoggables` or something?\n\nThat way, the line below while registering `menuObject` loggable becomes a bit more understandable: we register `menuObject` as loggable and then register its children as loggable as well. WDYT?",
