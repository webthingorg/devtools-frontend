      "message": "I\u0027m not sure about having the full file path in the accessible name, for similar reasons to my reservations about having {type} up front - e.g. there is a reason you don\u0027t _show_ the full file path by default. \n\nIn terms of giving access to the full file path, it looks  like we support aria-description now, so you could just provide the full path (with the filename) as the aria-description, and the filename alone as the title?",

      "message": "Oh sorry, it was my understanding that it wasn\u0027t necessary given the full path as it would lead to duplication, as it was already in the tooltip. The only part that the aria-description would differ from the tooltip is the nodeType, which would be obtained from the aria-label in the first place. Is my understanding wrong? Thanks for your thorough review!",
