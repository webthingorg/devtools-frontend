      "message": "We already limit the screenshot size by the 2^14 here, so this commit just brings more consistency: https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:third_party/devtools-frontend/src/front_end/models/emulation/DeviceModeModel.ts;l\u003d732\n\n\u003e would this lead to more regression bugs? e.g. what if the GPU is disabled but we are still limiting the height? \n\nCurrently there is a side-effect which makes the behaviour different in case of GPU and non-GPU. This change makes the screenshot logic more consistent.\n\n\u003e What if GPU limits change? \n\nWe would need to change the limit in DevTools anyway.\n\n\u003e Why is there a limit, btw?\n\nThe limit is (as I understand) in the GPU rendering implementation.\n\n\u003e Can we fix it by using the device scale factor instead?\n\nIf you mean calculating limit based on the device scale factor, that requires adding new parameter `cssToPhysicalPixelRation`, which seems quite weird, as in the front end we always rely on the CSS pixels.\n\nIf you mean a device emulation, the problem is the emulation changes the page layout, which leads to incorrect screenshots.",
