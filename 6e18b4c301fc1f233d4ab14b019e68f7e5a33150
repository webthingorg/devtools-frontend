      "message": "I tried using `this._handleGutterClick` as is and it was working fine. I\u0027m not sure why because from my experience you need to `.bind(this)` a function because otherwise the `this` object will not be what you expect. So I decided to bind it, just to be sure. I think maybe the addEventListener of textEditor doesn\u0027t work the same internally as addEventListener on HTMLElements.\n\nSorry for making such a mess by the way, this is my first time contributing to a google project and there were some issues. Not sure why you got added as a reviewer to this CL. I have abandonned all invalid CLs.\nAlso apparently I left this reply as a draft without actually submitting it smh.",
