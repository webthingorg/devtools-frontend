      "message": "It was already problematic, if you have a custom parent provider returning a non-annotated element. We will call `getLoggingState` on it with the intention of getting the existing state, but it fact would trigger creating state for an element without a valid config, which will cause errors further down the line.\n\nIt becomes apparent now, when we made config an explicit parameter: in some context you simply don\u0027t have a config and you don\u0027t need to have one as you expect state to already exist.",
