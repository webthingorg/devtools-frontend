      "message": "My promise logic is a bit rusty, if the checkRemoteObjectThenReveal rejects, does this revealPromise() function also reject?\n\nI think what I had in mind was a check on the result of pushObjectAsNodeToFrontend(), which would result in the same reject as line 979, but I think this does the same thing, so feel free to leave if so. Just want to make sure the reject msg propagates out of this function.",
