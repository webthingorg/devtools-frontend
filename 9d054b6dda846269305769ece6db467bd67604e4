(Yeah, exactly what you\u0027re doing here with resize/Intersection Obs\u0027s).\n\nI am not 100% sure it\u0027s fine with shadow roots, but my manual test just now confirms that a MutationObs can also observe multiple discrete trees. Did you deliberately want to keep multiple instances of this one?\n\nNot a huge deal to me, either way.",
