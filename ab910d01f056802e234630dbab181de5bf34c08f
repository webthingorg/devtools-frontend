      "message": "I think this was the reason for the flake; for some reason on mac clicking this button sometimes does not clear the data, I have checked the source code and it adds the event listener to the button before attaching it to the DOM so I was not sure why this was happening. The solution (or workaround) is to try clearing again until the quota usage is 0. I did not consider that this changes the scenario because 1) Clicking the button again does not change things enough for it to become a new scenario and 2) this is technically a cleanup step so it is not part of the story.",
