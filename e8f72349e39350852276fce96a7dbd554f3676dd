E.g. would the following work?\n\n```\nexport type Events \u003d {\n  IssuesCountUpdated: void,\n  FullUpdateRequired: void,\n  IssueAdded: {\n    issuesModel: SDK.IssuesModel.IssuesModel,\n    issue: Issue,\n  },\n}\n```\n\nAnd then where we currently rely on a specific Event from `Events`, we would be able to type it as `keyof Events` instead?",
