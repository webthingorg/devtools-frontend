But rubber stamping since no harm will be done in case you want to try...\n\nReasons: The recipe interacts with depot_tools API for CLs to fetch the changed files. Post-commit there is no such thing.\n\nIn V8 we run a dedicated own recipe that hooks up our own \"v8_presubmit.py\" script. It shares some of the presubmit checks with the real PRESUBMIT.py, but passes all files of the workspace instead.",
