# Ensure the origin of an attribution URL redirect is trustworthy

An attribution was not recorded because origin of the attribution redirect URL was
not trustworthy. For an redirect of the form `https://<attributionreportto>/.well-known/attribution-reporting/trigger-attribution[?data=<data>]`, the `<attributionreportto>` origin must be trustworthy.
