/**
 * Components don't orchestrate their DOM updates in a wider context
 * (i.e. the host frame's document), which leads to interleaved reading
 * and writing of layout-centric values, e.g. clientHeight, scrollTop etc.
 *
 * This helper to ensure that we do reads, writes, and scrolls at the
 * correct point in the frame lifecycle. It groups reads to the start of a
 * frame, where we can assume layout-centric values are available on the
 * basis of the last completed frame, and then it runs all writes
 * afterwards. In the event that a read / write / scroll callback contains
 * calls for more read / write / scroll calls, such calls will be scheduled
 * for the next available frame.
