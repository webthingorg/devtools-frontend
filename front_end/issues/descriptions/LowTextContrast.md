# Increase color contrast to improve accessibility

The contrast ratio is a relationship between the foreground and background colorsâ€™ luminance. When foreground and background colors have similar luminance, the contrast ratio is low. When the colors are different, the ratio is high. Low-contrast text is difficult or impossible for many users to read.

WebAIM guidelines recommend a minimum contrast ratio (AA) of 4.5 for all text. The perception of the colors is also affected by the font size and weight. Therefore, an exception is made for very large and/or bold text that is allowed to have the contrast ratio of 3.0. The enhanced level of conformance (AAA) requires the contrast ratio to be above 7.0 for regular text and 4.5 for the large text.

Resolve this issue by updating colors and/or by changing the font size or weight to achieve sufficient contrast issue. You can use the Suggest color feature in DevTools color picker to automatically pick a better text color.
