      "message": "My change is here: https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/devtools/devtools-frontend/+/2266998\n\nSo I was making the switch to encodeURIComponent as well because it was necessary to create some sort of consistency in what is escaped and how. So this change is redundant with the one I\u0027m working on but it\u0027s also a lot smaller and could reduce the size of my cl a little.\n\nDoes this do the right thing for snippet names with \u0027/\u0027 in them?\n\nWould it be possible to reproduce the bug this is fixing with the snippet name test I\u0027m adding?",

      "message": "Yes, it works with `/` in snippet names. I think the test would not reproduce this bug though because it involves closing and reopening DevTools which the test does not seem to cover.\n\nI will wait for your change to land and rebase + try to write a test case. Another issue that this CL is fixing is the Search tab where you can search for snippets by content.",
