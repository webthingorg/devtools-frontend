      "message": "This isn\u0027t updating the text for Voice Over ðŸ˜ž. It reads out the first aria-label, but it doesn\u0027t read out the new contents once it\u0027s been updated. \n\nHowever, a user can still navigate this like a normal table, and it\u0027s not a regression from the previous behavior since you couldn\u0027t read the contents of the selected element before either.\n\nMy opinion: This should be safe to check in given there is no regression on mac (unless someone finds something else) and is a significant improvement on windows (works with both NVDA and Narrator). We can file a bug on the platform and see how long it will take to get that fixed. Alternatively, maybe this pattern would work well with an aria-live region in place of the aria-label? AFAIK those behave well on mac",
