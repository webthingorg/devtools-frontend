      "message": "Sorry, I don\u0027t feel comfortable accepting this change as-is. My concerns:\n\n  * The CL causes layout and e2e test failures that need to be addressed. For once, the e2e tests failure seem related and not caused due to flakiness. Are the layout tests wrong and need to be re-baselined or those this change break them?\n  * There is no regression test that demonstrates what this CL is actually fixing. (The bug report\nalso doesn\u0027t have any kind of reproduction to verify this change)\n  * There is no reasoning in the CL description why we need to dispatch the event here and, more importantly, why it is safe to do so.\n     ",

I intended to share this hoping that you\u0027d just see it and be like \"OH SHOOT! GOOD CALL!\"  but given that\u0027s not the case, I\u0027ll happily close it.\n\nThanks for taking the time!",
