The description should roughly describe what was done, why it was done and what are the expected effects of the CL.",

      "message": "Hi Jaro,\n\nYeah, I meant to send it but Gerrit doesn\u0027t do a great job in showing the diff here.\n\nWhat this does is actually quite simple and is a pure refactoring: we used to have a `BreakpointSidebarPane` UI.Widget that didn\u0027t do anything other than embedding `BreakpointsView` Lit component. When user performed some action, `BreakpointsView` Lit component would send an event, that `BreakpointSidebarPane` UI.Widget listened to and delegated handling to the `BreakpointsSidebarController`. \n\nThe reason for using events here, I suppose, is that `BreakpointsView` is in the `front_end/panels/sources/components`, while `BreakpointSidebarPane` and `BreakpointsSidebarController` are in `front_end/panels/sources` and since `sources` depend on `components`, `components` cannot depend on `sources` and thus cannot invoke methods directly.  \n\nNone of this makes much sense to me TBH.\n\nI\u0027ve implemented a `LegacyWrapper` UI.Widget previously that can wrap Lit component in a generic way.\n\nThis CL does the following:\n1) moves `BreakpointsSidebarController` with no changes from `front_end/panels/sources/BreakpointsSidebarPane.ts` to the `front_end/panels/sources/components/BreakpointsView.ts` file\n2) Removes `BreakpointsSidebarPane`. \n  2a) Replaces its usage with `LegacyWrapper\u003cBreakpointsView\u003e`\n  2b) Makes `BreakpointsView` call `BreakpointsSidebarController` directly instead of sending events that used to be handled by `BreakpointsSidebarPane`\n3) Updates the tests of `BreakpointsView` to account for 2b)\n4) Moves the tests of `BreakpointsSidebarController` from `BreakpointsSidebarPane_test.ts` to `BreakpointsView_test.ts`\n\nThe diff is so big because 1) and 4).\nHere\u0027s are diff of `BreakpointsSidebarPane.ts` and `BreakpointsView.ts`: \n https://diff.googleplex.com/#key\u003dUpVxPmEExc8O  \nand respective tests:  https://diff.googleplex.com/#key\u003dcQh3xsj9zfde",

      "message": "Ah, I did not mean to type this into a comment, I meant typing into the CL description so that it appears in the git log (descriptions are very valuable when bisecting or when browsing blame in code search or some such). Whoever stumbles upon the CL would have a hard time figuring out what is going from just looking at the code or at the current description.\n\nCould you at least mention in the description that it is refactoring with no (intended) functional changes? (I still think it would be better to have some tracking bug for such changes so that you can look up how this was done elsewhere and why this was done if you think there might be a bug.)",
