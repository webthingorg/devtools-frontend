      "message": "Yes, I think it is. There were a few things that needed to be fixed for instrumentation breakpoints to be turned on for this example, but I think everything is done by now. Al, could you try to turn on the instrumentation breakpoint experiment for these tests (Note: it won\u0027t work for (\u0027[crbug.com/1407186] for pre-loaded workers) yet, I\u0027m currently working on a fix: https://crrev.com/c/4248192)? For adding instrumentation breakpoints, you\u0027ll need to add:\n\n```\nawait enableExperiment(\u0027instrumentationBreakpoints\u0027);\n```",
