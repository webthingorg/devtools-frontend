      "message": "Definitely not ideal: in order to know whether a condition was edited after opening the dialog from the sidebar, I\u0027m keeping a state in the BreakpointSidebarPane and wait for it to get notified whether the condition was edited or not. If it was, I\u0027m logging it using UMA, to know whether people are actuallly using the edit icon (and not \n\nThe revealing happens through the Reveal API, so we don\u0027t really know anything about the DebuggerPlugin here, and vice versa it doesn\u0027t know where the reveal is coming from, and changing the `reveal` API to include the caller feels too much of an invasion given that we only want to do this for UMA, and that we\u0027ll remove this eventually after the post-launch.",

      "message": "Since both are in the `panels/sources` module, we could have a global `ObjectWrapper` instance in the DebuggerPlugin or BreakpointEditDialog that dispatches \"BreakpointEdited\" events when the dialog is done editing. (We could also port the DebuggerPlugin to use that event instead of the current completion callback).\n\nThe sidebar pane here can then install a listener so we reduce the coupling a bit if we are worried about that.\n\nRegardless, I\u0027m wondering if we need to stash away the breakpoint and match it to the breakpoint we might pass to `notifyBreakpointCiditionEnabled` or the event.

      "message": "I\u0027ve changed the code to have a debuggerPluginWrapper object that dispatches events that one can listen to. Is that what you imagined it to be?\n\nRegarding the second question: Good question. In theory reveals could potentially overlap since they are async. I\u0027ve stored the breakpoint now instead of a boolean. Since the `editBreakpointCondition` is synchronous and is closing the previous opened one, we should always at some point get the correct/matching breakpoint for processing this event.",

Maybe if we move the wrapper to BreakpointeEditDialog and DebuggerPlugin also uses the event? That would make \"cancellation\" in the revealer awkward though.\n\nI\u0027ll let Jaro chime in :)",
