      "message": "Hey Marijn!\n\nin the CL crrev.com/c/4524940\u0027s first patchset there was some test failures. I\u0027ve understood the issue and created a reproduction case here.\n\nWhat happens in that CL is:\n* `@codemirror/view`\u0027s this commit[1] causes the `#activeEditor`s EditorView reference to be retained and used for dispatching a transaction after `TextEditor` is removed from the DOM (meaning that `#activeEditor` is nulled). In the handler of the previous reference\u0027s `dispatch` we call the `textEditor.editor` which is a different editor than the previous one and its state might be changed.\n\nI have added a reproduction test case but didn\u0027t have time to fix it yet. Do you have a suggestion on how we should fix it?\n\n[1]: https://github.com/codemirror/view/commit/70a9a253df04a57004247b9463198c17832f92f4#diff-306633a4b2416fe4a2c298e7201348ad340e11f3cf64ece4133de41401880f28R307\n(particularly dispatchFocus part in `update` implementation)",
