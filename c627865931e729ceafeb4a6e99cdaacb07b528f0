Ideally the existing tests should be migrated, and any new tests would be authored not as layout tests, but instead either as a unit / e2e test.",

      "message": "We\u0027ll have to rework some things in LH to realize this vision: we made the LH repo the \"source of truth\" for the layout tests + made a way to run them from LH repo last August, and we\u0027ve seen many benefits since. So we now occasionally add more layout tests when adding features that may have compat issues inside devtools.\n\nRight now it only runs the layout tests. I haven\u0027t looked into running the e2e tests.\n\nsee: https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/blob/407bc5b9393d00343ada2b445ba05e2b195ff348/package.json#L72",
