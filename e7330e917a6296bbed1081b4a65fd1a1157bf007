Or does such a location exist?\n\nI considered it when working on the CL, but decided against it since their use case is so specific to this context. It didn’t feel helpful to `export` any of these functions since we only need them locally (similar to e.g. disabledRulesCallback above).\n\nThen again, Paul brought this up as well. I can\u0027t tell whether y’all just wanted to make sure it was something I had considered (I have!) or whether there is some strong reason to make these utilities importable. Let me know if it’s the latter — I’d be happy to revisit this as a follow-up.",
