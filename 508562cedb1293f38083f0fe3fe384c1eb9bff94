      "message": "It looks like all the URLs in BreakpointManager come from either Script or from UISourceCode (which in turn gets them from Script.) Scripts are created by DebuggerModel, so you\u0027re not done with UrlStrings in DebuggerModel!\n\nCan you make UISourceCode.url() return a UrlString? If you also strictly type the constructor for Script(), will that cause this CL to explode?\n\nWe\u0027re getting close to the source of all urls here, let\u0027s add typing to UISourceCode and Script and save all the casts downstream.",

And I think at a minimum you should move the casts out of BreakpointManager and into UISourceCode/Script, because so many files get URLs from those classes that it should help you remove casts elsewhere too.",
