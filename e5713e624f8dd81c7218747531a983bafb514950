Using red and green are particularly problematic, see [1] for details. \n\nIf feasible, using checkmark vs \"X\" could be helpful. Are colours used elsewhere in the devtools UI?

I\u0027d like to know if that usage has been approved for accessibility, and is a reasonable precedent to follow.\n\nI think we can address the accessibility questions with more investigation, and make changes in a follow up CL as needed.\n\nWould you note the followup somewhere? I\u0027m not sure if a TODO is reasonable, or maybe a comment on the issue?",
