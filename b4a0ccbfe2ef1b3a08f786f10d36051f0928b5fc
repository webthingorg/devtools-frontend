      "message": "good catch! This actually was sort of needed the way it was because at some points we iterated over the event categories array. Using an `enum` for that would have needed to be declared as non-const enum, which was discouraged by an es-lint rule because TypeScript cannont inline such enums at compile time.\n\nHowever with https://crrev.com/c/5222921 that es-lint rule is gone (fortunately) and we can declare this as a non-const emum, which I agree is more practical than declaring two variables for a type :)\n\nDone.
