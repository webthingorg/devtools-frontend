      "message": "Hey Connor, I would like to remove the `self.Runtime.cachedResources` global and this CL works for DevTools. However, I found a reference to the global in the `report-generator.js` from LightHouse. Is LightHouse able to use ES imports of DevTools frontend files? I also recall we were loading the `report-generator.js` as `script` rather than as `module`, but I think we fixed that by now? Let me know what your thoughts are.",
