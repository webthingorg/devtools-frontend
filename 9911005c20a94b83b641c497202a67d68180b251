      "message": "this kind of thing happens super frequently to me in this repo - My understanding is that the devtools team works on devtools as a standalone thing in it\u0027s own repo that isn\u0027t part of chromium_src/third_party. as a result, a ton of the scripts break when you try to use them from within the chromium third_party directory. I\u0027ve sometimes kept a second standalone checkout to try to mimick the setup that the scripts were written for, but in your case i think the best move is to probably just manually apply the patch from the bottom of the failed bot on patch set 2: https://logs.chromium.org/logs/devtools-frontend/buildbucket/cr-buildbucket/8839353254192420913/+/u/presubmit_py3/stdout\nand then upload it bypassing hooks again.",
