      "message": "I think that\u0027d definitely be better! I have tried doing that and it turned out be a quite big change considering two things:\n* There are quite a lot of dependencies in init function to the internal variables that is scattered around different functions (buildMainCascade, buildPseudoCascades...)\n* We\u0027re creating a NodeCascade in initialization and it has a reference to the CSSMatchedStyles instance which I couldn\u0027t find a good way to abstract away.\n\nSo, WDYT of submitting this CL to fix the issue and tackling this refactoring in a separate CL; maybe we can also sit together and try to find a good way of doing it?",
