      "message": "Hey Wolfgang, thank you so much for testing it! I think the issues came from the resizer position calculation, where small pixel shift may result in noOp because the number is rounded after calculation. I increased the number from 2 to 3px and the issues seems to be fixed on my end. Could you try and let me know if it works? Thanks!",
