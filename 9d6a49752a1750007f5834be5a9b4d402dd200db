      "message": "Hey Wolfgang, thank you so much for testing it! I think the issues came from the resizer position calculation, where small pixel shift may result in noOp because the number is rounded after calculation. I increased the number from 2 to 3px and the issues seems to be fixed on my end. Could you try and let me know if it works? Thanks!",

      "message": "Thank you for testing! I took a close look, the distance of shifting is calculated by percentage of pixel against window in updateCurtains(), which CSS would only accept up to a certain decimal point. This results in faster movement of decrementing (left arrow) and slower movement of incrementing (right arrow). I added a 2px shift for incrementing to balance the speed of both directions.\nI added some comments in the code. Let me know if this works!",

      "message": "Spent more time one this today, I think the issue does not actually come from updateCurtains, sorry if I\u0027m making this really confusing! I found that if I update the ResizerOffset to 5px, the right and left shift are now balanced, but to be honest I\u0027m not sure where the initial 3.5px value came from. I think this was used to make up some of CSS value set for the resizer component, but when CSS file got updated, this value didnt get updated along with it, hence the regression. Let me know if you have a better fix or any insights on this. Thank you so much!",
