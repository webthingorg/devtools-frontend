This means that we only rollup files that have actually changed, rather than all of them all the time (which is the current behavior of `build_release_applications.py`).\n\nI am not sure yet as to how we can move to that world though. Will have to think of possible migration paths on how to remove the madness that is build_release_applications.py.",
