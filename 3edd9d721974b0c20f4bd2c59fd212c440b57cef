      "message": "Since it is listed in the `outputs`, I don\u0027t think we can. The stamp file is only used here to tell GN that it ran the action. Any `action` always has to include `outputs`. If we don\u0027t generate the file in the `outputs`, then Ninja thinks that it should rerun the action indefinitely. Therefore, we have to write an empty file somewhere, list it in the `outputs` and then Ninja will properly run the action only when necessary. As far as I am aware, anything listed in `outputs` should be in `gen/`.",
