A keyboard focus/hover provides a preview, so the user can directly see how the suggestion will look like on the canvas.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/Ms24dpv\n\nI think it\u0027s enough explanation to switch the icons next to AA and AAA if the user hovers a suggestion - it should become clear that this is a suggestion related to contrast. A tooltip on longhover can we \"Replace with suggested color\"",
