I think I agree with Patrick on not using the rotation angle until we have a UX discussion, and then applying the change consistently?\n\nI think we might need to rework some of the backend calculations to handle rotations for line numbers/names, etc (we just calculate 1 coordinate instead of 2), and I really like how it is done with this change. Hopefully we can base it off this",
