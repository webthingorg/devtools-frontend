Is this something that would be worth checking in?\n\nThere is more work to do, none necessarily blocking checkin:\n - The timeout on unit tests is too short\n - The e2e tests won\u0027t shut down when debugging. This is due to a conflict between the debugger and the hosted mode server and could be complicated or impossible to fix, but it doesn\u0027t stop you from stepping through tests.\n - The build error matcher doesn\u0027t seem to do anything.\n ",
