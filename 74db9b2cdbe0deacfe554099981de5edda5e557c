      "message": "I wasted a day making VSCode more productive. Is this something that would be worth checking in?\n\nThere is more work to do, none necessarily blocking checkin:\n - The timeout on unit tests is too short\n - The e2e tests won\u0027t shut down when debugging. This is due to a conflict between the debugger and the hosted mode server and could be complicated or impossible to fix, but it doesn\u0027t stop you from stepping through tests.\n - The build error matcher doesn\u0027t seem to do anything.\n ",

      "message": "The difference is that you can debug from VSCode instead of Chrome DevTools. Upsides of this are that you can set breakpoints before you launch, and you can do this over a remote VSCode, which might be marginally more convenient depending on your workflow, and you can launch by hitting F5 or from the Run and Debug sidebar pane. I don\u0027t think it enables new debugging abilities, though. I did not realize until I was looking at how to modify the docs that you can debug the node.js side of an e2e test from DevTools.",
