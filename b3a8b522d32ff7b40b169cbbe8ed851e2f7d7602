      "message": "By waiting for the primary page target, this seems to fix the behaviour described in the bug.\n\nBut there are still problems with the `waitForDebuggerInPage` functionality. With the tab target experiment turned off, DevTools freezes code execution in the page and the debugger shows being paused in a certain line (and CDP receives a `Debugger.paused` event). With the tab target experiment, DevTools freezes code execution, but the debugger does not show execution being paused (CDP `Debugger.pause` is sent, but no `Debugger.paused` is received from the BE).",
