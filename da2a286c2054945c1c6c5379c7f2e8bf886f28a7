      "message": "Mostly to avoid checking if bucket is present and if not, have a separate path for the storage key only. \n\nI didn\u0027t know that storage bucket is a \"new storage key\". Can it be applied everywhere where we have storage key currently? \n\nHow sure are we about the API? How plausible is it that we will have to revisit the fundamental concepts here?",
