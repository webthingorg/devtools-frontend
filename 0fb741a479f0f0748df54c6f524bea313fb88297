Elsewhere in DevTools I often see stuff like this:\n\n```\n@media (forced-colors: active) {\n  .icon-basic {\n    forced-color-adjust: none;\n    background-color: ButtonText;\n    color: HighlightText;\n  }\n}\n```\nIs it enough to turn off color adjustment or do I need to explicitly set some colors as well? Since this selector applies to a lot of different icons, I think it makes more sense to not enforce a specific color.",
