      "message": "Note that this misses some cases of valid CSS where parts of the URL are escaped. E.g. `\\64 ata:` (with the space) is equivalent to `data:` in CSS strings and identifiers, but this code wouldn’t consider the former to be a data URL. It might be fine, since this seems like uncommon behavior — but it’s a limitation to be aware of.\n\nQuick example:\n\n    html {\n      background: url(\\64 ata:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAwAAAAMCAAAAABzHgM7AAAAF0lEQVR42mM4Awb/wYCBYg6EgghRzAEAWDWBGQVyKPMAAAAASUVORK5CYII\u003d);\n    }\n\nHave we considered a different approach altogether? Instead of trying to reparse the CSS with regular expressions, could we rely on CSP instead?",

      "message": "Yes, we did consider applying CSP: https://crbug.com/1223475. Although it is kinda tricky: In some cases we don\u0027t want to apply CSP, e.g. when loading source maps. Where as in cases like this we\u0027d like CSP to apply. I have no idea how/where to implement this in the backend, so the DevTools renderer handles requests differently depending on what we are loading or who initiated it. (E.g. an explicit load for a source map vs an implicit load from CSS).\n\nLong story short, this is probably an appropriate band-aid until we have a proper plan for the backend.\n\nW.r.t to escaped urls, I\u0027m not sure allowing an escaped `data:` warrants  the increased implementation complexity.
