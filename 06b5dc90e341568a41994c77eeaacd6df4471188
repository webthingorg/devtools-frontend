      "message": "Note that this misses some cases of valid CSS where parts of the URL are escaped. E.g. `\\64 ata:` (with the space) is equivalent to `data:` in CSS strings and identifiers, but this code wouldn’t consider the former to be a data URL. It might be fine, since this seems like uncommon behavior — but it’s a limitation to be aware of.\n\nQuick example:\n\n    html {\n      background: url(\\64 ata:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAwAAAAMCAAAAABzHgM7AAAAF0lEQVR42mM4Awb/wYCBYg6EgghRzAEAWDWBGQVyKPMAAAAASUVORK5CYII\u003d);\n    }\n\nHave we considered a different approach altogether? Instead of trying to reparse the CSS with regular expressions, could we rely on CSP instead?",
