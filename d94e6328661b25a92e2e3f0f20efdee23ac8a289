      "message": "Having multiple checks in here for the experiment feels slightly brittle and the logic is hard to follow. Wdyt of moving the experiment check way earlier into the constructor? (Assuming experiments are available at construction time). This way, the whole class becomes a No-Op should the experiment be disabled.\n\nDownside would be that a DevTools restart is required when the experiment is enabled, but I always thought thats the norm for most experiments anyway.",
