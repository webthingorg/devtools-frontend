      "message": "This startFrame(), as the first frame after an idle period, is removed in the current CL.\n\nIn the old visualization, this frame is a special case in that its visualization does not start at DrawFrame as other frames, but rather at {commit_triggerTime | first_begin_frame_after_idle_period | end_of_idle_period}, whichever is first applicable.\n\nIn the new visualization, on the other hand, such \"half-frames\" are no longer allowed and frames always begin with BeginFrame. Therefore we remove this frame, and lump the CPU time into the next full frame instead if applicable (line 184~186 of patch 5).",
