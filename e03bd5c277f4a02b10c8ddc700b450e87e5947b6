      "message": "Hi Jaro, hi Simon,\n\nI\u0027m doing a refactoring of the BreakpointManager which will also get rid of the deadlock that we experienced, since `ModelBreakpoint.scheduleUpdateInDebugger` would be able to call itself again (either directly, or through removing the outer `Breakpoint`).\n\nPTAL and let me know what you think. My goals with the refactoring was:\n\n1. Letting the breakpoint decide whether or not it should be removed (and not the ModelBreakpoint)\n2. Having just one single point where `scheduleUpdateInDebugger` is called, to properly take care of removing breakpoints (see point 1 above)\n3. Make it clear what is the result of `scheduleUpdateInDebugger` (do we need to re-run, was there an error?)\n\nNote that there is a failing layout test. This is due to changed timing, since we have one more await when scheduling an update (i.e. it needs to wait a bit longer before the breakpoint is set). I\u0027ll adapt the test, but will wait until I know how this CL turns out.",
