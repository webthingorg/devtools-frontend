      "message": "Not going to leave a -1 review, because I am OOO next week and do not want to block, but please make sure the imports are updated to follow the DevTools convention before this lands. \n\nAll imports that import from a different module must use the entry point to do so. In a release build a module is bundled up to all be contained in its entry point, and hence in our code we have to follow-suit. It might work in dev (where we don\u0027t bundle) but broken imports will cause release build breakage.",
