      "message": "I don\u0027t have a particularly strong opinion here. I don’t think there’s a *technical* requirement to create a new histogram. However, if we re-use the same histogram analyzing the data becomes more tricky (we need to remember the day the set of metrics changed in order to interpret things correctly)… but maybe that\u0027s fine. When in doubt we could create a new histogram.",

      "message": "I think I agree with Mathias\u0027 points above. I think things would get confusing if we use the same name with new settings. I would prefer to either\n1) Map the new setting names to their \"old\" setting names where it still applies. For instance, extendGridLines.true could map to showGridLines.extended-dashed, etc. We would then keep the settings in the same place and not update the backend.\n2) If we go with new histogram enum values, we should create a new histogram and mark the old one as obsolete so we don\u0027t get confused. If we don\u0027t create a new histogram: some channels would have the old mapping, and some the new at the same time, the data would get mixed together and be unusable.\n\nI think my preference would be (2) for clarity sake, which would require a backend update first.",
