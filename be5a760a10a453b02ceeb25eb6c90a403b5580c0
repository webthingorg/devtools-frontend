      "message": "Hmm, that would work nicely indeed. We\u0027re using a path for drawing the area simply because that\u0027s how all other shapes are drawn in the overlay at the moment. Even though most (all?) of them are simple rectangles. I\u0027m not too sure why this was originally done this way rather than sending a bunch of coordinates to the overlay (as you suggest) and letting it construct the path itself (which it does anyway right now). \nMy feeling though is: if we did diverge from what the original way of doing things was, we should do it consistently, rather than just for this one feature.",
