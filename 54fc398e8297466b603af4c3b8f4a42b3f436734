      "message": "Thanks for the patch, this looks great! Could you please add a unit-test for the Log.ts and Linkifier.ts change to the src/test/unittests/front_end/models/har/HARLog_test.ts and third_party/devtools-frontend/src/test/unittests/front_end/ui/components/Linkifier_test.ts respectively?\n\nThere are also bunch of tests in chromium that *might* need updating. See e. g. third_party/blink/web_tests/http/tests/devtools/har-importer.js and third_party/blink/web_tests/http/tests/devtools/network/har-content.js\n\nSee https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git/+/HEAD/docs/testing/web_tests.md\nfor details on these tests. Basically you need to checkout chromium, patch in your devtools change, build it and run tests under third_party/blink/web_tests/http/tests/devtools with `third_party/blink/tools/run_web_tests.py -t Default \n third_party/blink/web_tests/http/tests/devtools`. I don\u0027t expect you to update these more then what\u0027s required for them to pass. Generally, we\u0027re migrating away from these tests in chromium, so any investments in these apart from keeping them green is strictly optional.",

I cannot change them before my changes are rolled out, otherwise they will fail and if I do not change them and my changes are rolled out, they will also fail.\nDo I need to fix them and first mark them as expected to fail, wait for the roll out and then mark them as expected to pass?",
