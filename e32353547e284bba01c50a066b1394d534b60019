      "message": "Rather than updating the runner with the logic to open a panel, can we instead have `timeline-helpers` that implement it?\n\nI would like to prevent us from doing custom things for, for example, loading. If we deviate how we load in our tests from how a user would do, we might introduce more problems. Moreover, the changes in the runner itself look complex and add more complexity to the system. Especially as it writes to localStorage, which by-steps what a user would do.",

      "message": "No, I don\u0027t think we can. The reason I updated the runner is because we were assuming the Elements panel and therefore waiting for the .elements selector. But the UserMetrics code explicitly tracks the first opened panel, which means that when we then switch over to the timeline panel we are no longer looking at the first panel (which was Elements) and therefore the PanelLoaded event doesn\u0027t fire. So then we have to intercept before the page loads to catch the events etc.",
