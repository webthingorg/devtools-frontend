      "message": "I\u0027ve updated this to reflect the changes made in the past weeks. The main change to this patch is that it now generates a bunch of chunks (most of which contain the code to support a specific language) that can be dynamically imported via shims in the main bundle.\n\nI\u0027m fine with merging this as it is now. Without a doubt further library upgrades will be required in the near future, but I\u0027ll just include those in the relevant patches.",
