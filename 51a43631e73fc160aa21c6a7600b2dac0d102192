      "message": "I think, even though `parseResponse` can return an `action` without a `thought`, in reality it\u0027s not the case since we always expect the LLM to produce a thought first and then the action.\n\nOne other approach would be to throw an error when the `action` is not coming with a `thought` and report it as a parse error. Then, we can type the `ActionStep` with always containing a thought.\n\nThough continuing with how the code is currently structured and being defensive also sgtm so let\u0027s go with that and if we feel the need, we can update it later.",
