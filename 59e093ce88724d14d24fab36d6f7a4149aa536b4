      "message": "After checking the failing snapshots of about 100 runs there seems to be two steps the test is failing at: `selecting the search result that we need` and `waiting for retainer chain`. The first step failure looks like it can be solved with a longer timeout, the second one seems to be that the retainer chain that appears is not consistent every time (checkout the screenshots here https://ci.chromium.org/ui/p/devtools-frontend/builders/try/e2e_stressor_linux/b8789002250841925841/overview). My question is what would constitute a success in the step `waiting for retainer chain`? would it be enough if the expected elements appeared in the retain chain? or do they have to appear in order? or they have to be exact? I think relaxing this assertion might solve the flakiness. Do you have any suggestions how to go about it?",
