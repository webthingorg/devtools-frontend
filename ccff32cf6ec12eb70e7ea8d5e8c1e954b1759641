      "message": "Danil, PTAL. This has the side effect of making the responses to Fetch and XHR show up in Sources-\u003ePage (because there now exist UISourceCode objects for them). I did some archaeology and my change would basically undo https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id\u003d60321, which explicitly ensures that XHRs don\u0027t show up there. WDYT?",
