I think we should remember it, but I\u0027m not sure what the best strategy is: We could remember it per frame or globally (i.e. if one expands this list in one frame details view, it is expanded in every other view as well). For this to work we\u0027d likely want to include the expansion state in PermissionsPolicySectionData",
