      "message": "Looking quickly at the callers of this function, I have a feeling we could merge it with the new longhandPropertiesIncludingComputed.\nMaybe keep just one function called longhandProperties, and give it a second, optional, parameter to pass the DOM node. If passed, then computed values are also returned, otherwise it defaults to what longhandProperties does today.\nThis could be done later, as a cleanup, after this CL.",

      "message": "Good point, I initially did that, however since the function was changed to asynchronous, I was modifying too many files. So I ended up created a new async function. I will take a look at it again, if it takes too much time, I will cleanup after this CL as you suggested.",
