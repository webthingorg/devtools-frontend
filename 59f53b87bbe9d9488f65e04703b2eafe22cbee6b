      "message": "Hi, just to double check what this CL is doing - is it a bug fix or a feature? IIUC, what it does is highlighting all the cookies that were blocked for the domain, If so, it might be unrelated to the bug crbug.com/1506225 since that one is for 3PCD blocked cookies only. Also this makes the cookie table in the Application panel visually the same as the cookie table in the Network panel, is that intended for the Application panel?",

      "message": "I\u0027d consider it more a bug fix than a feature. Without this CL you\u0027d run into situations like here (https://i.imgur.com/hhX6s8B.png), where there are multiple warning icons, but a yellow background only for blocked set cookie operations. The reason why some cookies have a yellow background and others don\u0027t is not obvious to users, and I think it would be better to apply the yellow background to all blocked cookies.\nAnd yes, I think to decrease confusion it\u0027s good for the cookie tables in the network panel and in the application panel be as similar as possible.",
