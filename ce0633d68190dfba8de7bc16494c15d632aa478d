Thinking about when to land this, I think it will be safest to wait with this CL until I\u0027m back from vacation (I\u0027ll be out on vacation for 2 weeks), since it touches regularly used UX. I hope that is fine with you too! And thanks for bringing this up ðŸ˜Š",

      "message": "The \"solution\" to the regression with the triangle was to adapt the css to use `padding-left` instead of a margin that I previously used. The reason is the following: we are currently calculating where the click can be to be considered as \"the click was within the triangle\" using the left padding. See the code here: https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:third_party/devtools-frontend/src/front_end/ui/legacy/Treeoutline.ts;l\u003d1396;drc\u003d16493feab1822fbdd6e6f79894b397ca1ceab870\n\nThe calculation is not ideal. I\u0027ve looked into changing the calculation to at least use the `before` element, but that didn\u0027t work. Eventually we should move to using `span` for the triangle.\n\nThe reason for the very specific `3px` margin is that the triangle needs to have a size of 14px as it is a mask image. Ideally I would specify 20px (has a sys size) for the entire before element, but then the triangle is shifted.",

To have the same padding from left for the `li` element, we can tweak the above padding.\n\nWDYT?",

      "message": "Good point! If I understand correctly, this is a general Treeoutline problem right (let me know if I\u0027m misunderstanding)? In that case, wdyt about fixing the calculation instead? The calculation could contain a bit more meaning by using variable names. I think it is centered if we consider that the arrow icon width is 10px, but that it has some padding within the icon too, so we actually end up with the arrow icon starting around 2px \"later\". I have fixed this up in the latest patch set, but let me know if you don\u0027t agree with this and I can change it to the css only change that you suggested ðŸ˜Š!",
