      "message": "The \"solution\" to the regression with the triangle was to adapt the css to use `padding-left` instead of a margin that I previously used. The reason is the following: we are currently calculating where the click can be to be considered as \"the click was within the triangle\" using the left padding. See the code here: https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:third_party/devtools-frontend/src/front_end/ui/legacy/Treeoutline.ts;l\u003d1396;drc\u003d16493feab1822fbdd6e6f79894b397ca1ceab870\n\nThe calculation is not ideal. I\u0027ve looked into changing the calculation to at least use the `before` element, but that didn\u0027t work. Eventually we should move to using `span` for the triangle.\n\nThe reason for the very specific `3px` margin is that the triangle needs to have a size of 14px as it is a mask image. Ideally I would specify 20px (has a sys size) for the entire before element, but then the triangle is shifted.",

      "message": "I think the last issue I see after this change is that the click area is not centered for the expand icon: https://imgur.com/a/CQWPK6M so clicking on the right top point of the triangle doesn\u0027t make it expand.\n\nTo center it, we can add `margin-left: -3px` to the `::before` element and then it is centered. To have the same padding from left for the `li` element, we can tweak the above padding.\n\nWDYT?",
