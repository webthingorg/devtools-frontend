      "message": "Hey hey, I have some visual comments and I\u0027ll look into implementation details after discussing them :)\n\n1 - See the screenshot in https://g-issues.chromium.org/issues/40248266#comment25, the filter input is not vertically aligned in the middle, in the Elements panel usage. The top vertical margin is bigger than the bottom one.\n\n2 - See the screenshot in https://g-issues.chromium.org/issues/40248266#comment26. For Elements panel usage, when the width is constrained, elements overlap with each other, current behavior is that they maintain a min-width so that they don\u0027t overlap with each other. For the Sources panel usage, the buttons jump down (which might be fine).\n\n3 - See the screenshot in https://g-issues.chromium.org/issues/40248266#comment27; there are 3 things: a) hover state of the icon button overflows the input field, b) hovering over the clear button also triggers the hover state of the input field, c) the radius of the clear button is not looking in harmony with the input field\u0027s radius.\n\n3rd comment is also applicable to regex and case sensitive buttons.\nMaybe for 3a and 3c; we can use a button similar to the up / down carets; WDYT?",

      "message": "I\u0027ve addressed all but 3a and 3c. The up/down carets will also change to being the \"round\" type, as soon as Kateryna has updated the Toolbar buttons. For GM3 we will only have these \u0027round\u0027 buttons for icons going forward, so that will not be an option unfortunately.\n\nFor 3a, I was thinking of increasing the height of the search bar instead, it would look like this: https://i.imgur.com/6pMgptf.png\nI\u0027ve also send this info to Peter with the same suggestion. Not sure whether we can do much more for 3c if the buttons need to be round, but with the increased height it would also look better than with the current height. WDYT?",
