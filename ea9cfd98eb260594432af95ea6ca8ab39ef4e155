      "message": "So this is basically working (it needs a bugfix for not applying the edits immediately on save --- not issue the RPC to backend, string context strings and a lot of UI polish), so it seems useful to discuss how to proceed. I was thinking of at least splitting off StructuredHeaders* (which possibly should be in a separate dir --- it\u0027s pretty generic), as it\u0027s big, logically independent and I am sure warrants lots of feedback.\n\nOn that note, I don\u0027t know what this is trying to tell me to do:\n/usr/local/google/home/morlovich/cr/devtools/devtools-frontend/test/unittests/front_end/emulation/StructuredHeaders_test.ts\n  6:1  error  Incorrect cross-namespace import: \"../../../../front_end/emulation/StructuredHeaders.js\".
