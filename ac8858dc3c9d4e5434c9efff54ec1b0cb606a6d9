      "message": "TypeScript-side looking good. The only change would be to use `unknown` instead of `object`. It seems like these arguments are not used in the callbacks anyways, so this should be safe. The benefit of using `unknown` over `object` is that the former will block you from using it. This means that you *have* to make sure the structure is as it should be. With `object`, you don\u0027t get these guarantees (just like with `any`).",
