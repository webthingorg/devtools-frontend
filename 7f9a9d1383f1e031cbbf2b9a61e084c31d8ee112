We might need to think of another design. Sooo, input from Peter might be needed here.\n\n* I wonder if we can also do this for shorthand `animation` property as its usage is higher than using `animation-name` as a separate property. See here: https://chromestatus.com/metrics/css/popularity\n\nWDYT?",
