      "message": "Yep, it is added in `front_end/panels/elements/StylesSidebarPane.ts` line 1896[1] ðŸ˜…\n\nI\u0027m having some questions regarding the testing strategy. On one hand, we have a similar layout test in chromium/src[2] so maybe I can move it here. Though from my understanding, we should write E2E tests when they really capture our critical parts. So, I think having this as an E2E test (showing circular color swatch when a color with new syntax is present) might not be needed.\n\nSo, I\u0027m thinking of writing a unit test: testing CSSPropertyPrompt to render the color swatches correctly. Though I couldn\u0027t find a very good way of doing that. I was thinking to call `buildPropertyCompletions` in the test and expect that to return correct suggestion for the parameters. Though I wasn\u0027t sure how good of an idea it is since it seems like I\u0027m testing an implementation details. (Mainly, function name etc. ðŸ˜‚)\n\nWDYT, do you have a suggestion on what tests to write for this code? (and for the CL overall? ðŸ˜Š)\n\n[1]: https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/devtools/devtools-frontend/+/4013781/5/front_end/panels/elements/StylesSidebarPane.ts#1896\n[2]: https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:third_party/blink/web_tests/http/tests/devtools/elements/styles-3/style-autocomplete-swatches.js",
