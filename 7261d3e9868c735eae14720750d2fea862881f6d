      "message": "Mathias, PTAL. It seems that I originally introduced this bug in https://crrev.com/c/2485085. Do you think it would make sense to change the units to \u0027kbit/s\u0027 and \u0027Mbit/s\u0027 instead, so that it\u0027s clearer what these units stand for? I believe the throttling settings are the only place in DevTools where these unit labels are being used.",
