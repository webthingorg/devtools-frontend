The next time they would be updated, they would revert these changes.\n\nCould you let me know why we need to make these changes here? Is there maybe a way we can workaround it by reconfiguring esbuild or filing an upstream bug for them to resolve the problem?\n\nEdit: aha, I just saw you created https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1964 Let\u0027s see what the upstream maintainers say.",
