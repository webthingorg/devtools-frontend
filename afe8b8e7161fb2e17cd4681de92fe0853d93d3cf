The next time they would be updated, they would revert these changes.\n\nCould you let me know why we need to make these changes here? Is there maybe a way we can workaround it by reconfiguring esbuild or filing an upstream bug for them to resolve the problem?\n\nEdit: aha, I just saw you created https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1964 Let\u0027s see what the upstream maintainers say.",

      "message": "Changing extention of those files to .mjs works with esbuild, but that breaks tsc build like\nhttps://ci.chromium.org/ui/p/devtools-frontend/builders/try/devtools_frontend_linux_dbg/b8823822450801991089/overview\nwith https://crrev.com/c/3422728/1\n\nI\u0027m not sure why we see this kind of error. I tried to add `exclude: [\u0027**/*.mjs\u0027]` around some tsconfig.json, but that doesn\u0027t fix the error.\n\nThis maybe due to that TypeScript doesn\u0027t support ES module yet?\nhttps://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/esm-node.html\n\nDo you know how to fix this?",
