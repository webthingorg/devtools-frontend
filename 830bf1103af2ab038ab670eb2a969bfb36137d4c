      "message": "@bmeurer@chromium.org found that StepView unit tests do not test much and they also are dependent on a specific sub-component (Menu) implementation. I have tried to rewrite the component to decouple the presenter part from the view part and improve the unit tests somewhat. @dsv@chromium.org PTAL as well and let me know if this is a step in the right direction according to your proposal or if there is anything that I overlooked",
