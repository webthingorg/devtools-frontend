      "message": "it was a bit surprising to me that this isn\u0027t actually used to set the width of the element.\n\nit might be a good idea to explain at a higher level how we are positioning this - I find it a bit confusing figuring out why we aren\u0027t positioning the overlay just over the entry (like we do for the ENTRY_SELECTED overlay) and then within the component moving the label \u0026 the connector within the entry label component.\n\nI don\u0027t feel super strongly on how this is done, but a comment or some docs on this might help",
