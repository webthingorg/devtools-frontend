I think you could also filter based on the index to remove the value?\n\n```js\nconst index \u003d ...\n\nblockedCookieLines \u003d blockedCookieLines.filter((line, i) \u003d\u003e i !\u003d\u003d index)\nreturn false\n```\n\nAlthough this means we iterate over the entire array...\n\nOr you could splice?\n\n```js\nconst index \u003d ...\n\nblockedCookieLines.splice(index, 1)\n```\n\nBut really I don\u0027t think any of these is nicer than the others, I\u0027m just bike-shedding!",
