      "message": "Hi Michael,\n\nThanks for putting this CL together; I\u0027m always excited for us to add functionality that could help developers! I would, however, like to request a couple of things before this functionality is landed, so I\u0027m going to put a -1 on this CL for the time being. \n\nFirstly, it needs to be migrated to lit-html-based Web Components and authored in TypeScript[1]. We\u0027re actively moving away from Closure-based JavaScript, and all new functionality is being authored in TypeScript. (The reason you\u0027re seeing Closure throw errors about CSS Overview is because this has already been migrated.) \n\nSecondly, this is functionality that we expect developers to switch on and use, even experimentally, and so I\u0027d like to see unit tests added (and possibly an e2e test or two) so we have more confidence in it. The documentation on building newer UI covers adding testing, and we can be available if you have questions.\n\nThanks,\nPaul\n\n[1] https://goo.gle/building-ui-devtools",
