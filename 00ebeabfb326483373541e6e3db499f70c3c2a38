      "message": "For the reset button we ideally re-use the icon pattern from Wolfgang (used in header overrides, grey circular background on hover etc). If this is too much work, we should correct the sizing (the width and height from `.reset-budget-button` doesn\u0027t translate to the actual size). Right now it\u0027s at 9px size, 12px matches the the rest of the UI:\n\n```\n.icon-basic {\n  width: 12px;\n  height: 14px;\n}\n```\n\nI personally like the icon, however it\u0027s used for \"refresh\" and already in use on this panel at the top left for the reload action. In the performance panel settings we use another icon for refresh (see screenshot). For the sake of consistency we should also use it here.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/JuQXjXb.png\n\nFor the info icon, we should add vertical alignment `text-bottom` (similar to other places in the application panel) and give it 2px of margin left, so there is some spacing between the text label and the icon:\n\n```\n.info-icon {\n  vertical-align: text-bottom;\n  margin-left: 2px;\n}\n```",

      "message": "For the layout in general, I noticed that this page has three horizontal dividers (top part, table, table details). Other storage panels in the application panel try to avoid a triple division and instead split the information in sub panels, like IndexedDB:\n\nTop panel with geneal information: https://i.imgur.com/jiI3YwD.png\nSub panel with database table: https://i.imgur.com/ODfucSV.png\n\nShould it get too crowded or hard to navigate, this layout might be worth a shot.",

      "message": "I have now changed the icon.  I couldn\u0027t easily use \u0027largeicon-undo\u0027, as it\u0027s a legacy icon from https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:third_party/devtools-frontend/src/front_end/ui/legacy/Icon.ts;l\u003d252, whereas this class uses the non-legacy `IconButton` class.  But I chose the similar non-legacy \u0027ic_undo_16x16_icon\u0027 to use.  If you have a better suggestion, let me know.\n\nI have also modified the styling for the icons per your suggestion.\n\nI didn\u0027t change the overall layout, but did take note of your suggestion for future reference.  As it is, we will likely soon be removing the Creation Time row from the Metadata section, so that will make that smaller.\n\nCan you please take another look?  Thank you.",
