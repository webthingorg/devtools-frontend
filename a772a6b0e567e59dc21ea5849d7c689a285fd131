The source of the test is here https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:third_party/blink/web_tests/http/tests/devtools/elements/styles-3/styles-cancel-editing.js;l\u003d6;drc\u003ddb80066c712022bb2c9ede7ebd4c3221e589d7a9 I was not sure what incremental editing is but it looks like it\u0027s about entering a new style and pressing Escape.
