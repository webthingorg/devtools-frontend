      "message": "This is looking good and I like the behavior.\n\nI\u0027m really weirded out about including the value of \u003coption\u003e elements. It feels unnecessary and I think is likely to lead to confusion (example: with default settings I type \"scroll\" in the search box, and I get \"Flamechart mouse wheel action: Zoom\"). This feels like a bug, even though I can clearly see it\u0027s intentionally coded that way.",

      "message": "I find it a little unusual that settings search would search the individual option items of a select dropdown, e.g., I could search \"dark\" and find \"dark theme\". I mean, I guess that makes sense, but given that dropdown items don\u0027t have interior-selectable content, this doesn\u0027t behave the way I expect. (Perhaps \"dark\" makes more sense than searching against \"system\").\n\nI\u0027m not saying that we must change the behavior. It just feels weird.",
