      "message": "Tests failed due to changing expectations regarding user timings, since the previous patch \"extracted\" all timings, including Resource \u0026 Nav timing events (which we didn\u0027t originally intend to touch).  In hindsight, maybe the issue was that we were double-adding to Timings and not that we were removing from Main, but this newest patch still felt cleaner/safer.\n\nThere is another alternative: extract (not copy) only performance.marks() and leave everything else.  But this meant having the hardcoded list of resource/navigation event names in tracing/timeline model and we thought this was cleaner.\n\nRaphael can add comments to document these decisions (I suggest inside _copyUserTimingEvents).\n\nWDYT Paul, is it better to extract just perf.marks()?",

      "message": "In my opinion, copying the events rather than extracting is more future-proof, assuming the resource cost is extremely small.\n\nHowever unlikely it may be, if there is a reason those events might be needed for other uses in the Main thread, having them copied instead will create less of a headache for others later on.\n\n+1 Michal\u0027s comment about comments...
