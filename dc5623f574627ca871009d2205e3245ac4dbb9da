I wonder if we can do this in different way, that is a more of a generic solution or in a place where it is closer to `colorFormat` setting definition/rendering.\n\nThough since this is temporary, we can also accept this for now but a comment for explaining this and its temporay nature would be cool.

Also this bit is 95% about rendering, which to me means this file here is the right place. The alternative I considered was having some hookery on the settings registration or similar that the entrypoint could wire up, which calls back into here to delegate modifinying the presentation. I opted for locality and simplicity over the complexity of that, but I\u0027m open to reconsidering if you think it\u0027s worth it!",
