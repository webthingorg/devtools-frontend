I wonder if we can do this in different way, that is a more of a generic solution or in a place where it is closer to `colorFormat` setting definition/rendering.\n\nThough since this is temporary, we can also accept this for now but a comment for explaining this and its temporay nature would be cool. WDYT? :)",
