      "message": "what\u0027s the value of this over just using `TraceLoader.traceEngine` and executing the entire thing? Why have `runTraceEngine` and only exec a sub-set?\n\nBecause TraceLoader.traceEngine caches, it\u0027s not terribly expensive to run all the handlers even if we don\u0027t need them.\n\nGiven that we already have `TraceLoader.traceEngine`, I am reluctant to introduce another different way to run the traceEngine against events from a trace fixture.",
