      "message": "I was asking myself the same question...\n\nFirst, I don\u0027t like to call it `button` (and I should probably rename `dropDownButton` to `dropDown`) because I want to encode the function rather than appearance  in the persistent logs. We might want to change the appearance and would probably like to keep tracking the function usage. OTOH, if we change the function but keep the appearance, we certainly want this to be logged as something else.\n\nWe could call it `action` instead, and maybe it is a better idea indeed. For now I am a bit reluctant to do it, as those actions seem to be the most interesting VEs for analysis and they seem important enough to deserve their own VE. \n\nSimon, wdyt?",
