      "message": "A question about this test- it seems withNoMutations is only used with async/await, so is it still appropriate to use here? It seems like this block may not actually be running due to the lack of await and anything inside it will pass.\n\nAlso it feels like this test is not really testing the actual web component. Would you have any suggestions about how to improve this test, or if we could maybe remove it?",

      "message": "A good question! I think you are right and this line requires an await statement. And you are right that the test was not running completely. So I think window.getComputedStyle was not working as expected here. Since we are dispatching events directly to the tested component instance ourselves, they don\u0027t really affect the DOM so the :hover state won\u0027t set anywhere. Instead, we should check that node\u0027s hightlight functions are being called. I have updated this test. PTAL",
