      "message": "Hey Kim,\n\nDo you maybe know why the e2e-tests would be failing for this change? I would have assumed that the linear-memory-inspector didn\u0027t have any resources to load and that we can remove the module.json file. However, it appears that it has a silent dependency on the `-legacy.js` file and I can\u0027t really figure out where that dependency is coming from. Do you know how we might be inadvetently relying on the `-legacy.js` file?",

      "message": "Hi Tim,\n\nI\u0027m not 100% sure, since I do not completely understand the implications of module.js. The test that fails is about opening the linear memory inspector tab.
