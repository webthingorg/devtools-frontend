      "message": "Hey Kim,\n\nDo you maybe know why the e2e-tests would be failing for this change? I would have assumed that the linear-memory-inspector didn\u0027t have any resources to load and that we can remove the module.json file. However, it appears that it has a silent dependency on the `-legacy.js` file and I can\u0027t really figure out where that dependency is coming from. Do you know how we might be inadvetently relying on the `-legacy.js` file?",

      "message": "Hi Tim,\n\nI\u0027m not 100% sure, since I do not completely understand the implications of module.js. The test that fails is about opening the linear memory inspector tab.

      "message": "Thanks Kim for these hints! I initially was confused, as to why all of these calls were included, since linear-memory-inspector no longer uses anything related to Runtime. When I opened the meta file, I realized we still had the side-effect `loadModulePromise`, which is now also unnecessary. I removed that call, which should fix the view. Glad we have the e2e-tests ðŸ˜Š",
