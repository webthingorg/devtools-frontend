I would have assumed that the linear-memory-inspector didn\u0027t have any resources to load and that we can remove the module.json file. However, it appears that it has a silent dependency on the `-legacy.js` file and I can\u0027t really figure out where that dependency is coming from. Do you know how we might be inadvetently relying on the `-legacy.js` file?",
