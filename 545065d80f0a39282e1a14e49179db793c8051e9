      "message": "Instead of needing this for every component, could we re-use some more global theme setting? Not necessarily in JS, I mean. Imagine the devtools-frontend\u0027s \u003chtml\u003e gets `class\u003d\"dark-theme\"` or `class\u003d\"light-theme\"` depending on the selected theme. Could we not re-use that in our styles, without the need for any additional JS at the component level?\n\nOr, even better: the component should not care about the global class name, but instead just re-use globally defined CSS variables that are changed when the theme changes. (I understand this would be a larger change that might warrant a separate CL.)",
