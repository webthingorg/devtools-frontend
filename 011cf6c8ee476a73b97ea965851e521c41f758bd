I tested it on different scenarios and on the tryjobs (link at the end) and seems stable.\nI have limited knowledge on how Karma is initializing the tools, but from what I could tell this is the top of the chain, if there is a better place/way to do this I would appreciate any pointers ðŸ˜Š\n\nhttps://ci.chromium.org/p/devtools-frontend/builders/try/devtools_frontend_linux_rel/b8863052589055497680?",
