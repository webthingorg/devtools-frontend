      "message": "Still going through the comments and code, but have two functionality questions:\n\n1) Looks like we have the ability to change the grid settings from this new pane and the existing point in settings. Should we remove the settings page as part of this? or do a follow up?\n2) When changing the options with a persistent overlay active, nothing happens. I feel like we should update the persistent overlay to resend the command every time the settings change. wdyt?",

It has nice little icons that really do help visually.\nPassing in the setting type here means we can\u0027t do that. I think it would be good to introduce another level here between getting the settings and send them to the view layer. This level would take care of constructing the right types so we can then display those icons in the ui layer.\n\nDoing this as a separate CL is better though. This first foundational CL is great to get a panel going and then we can build on it iteratively.",
