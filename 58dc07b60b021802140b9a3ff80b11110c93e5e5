      "message": "This is already an improvement, but IMHO it would be even more readable (and simpler to implement, too!) to do what I suggested, i.e. use blocks for multi-line steps. That way we don\u0027t even need to number the variables, and each multi-line step is clearly separated in the output. WDYT?",
