      "message": "Hmmm feels like we could generalize this..   Two aspects..\n\nI see similar `lazyBlah \u003d null` on L173/174. So I\u0027m thinking why not lazySelectorStatsView there too.\n\nBut also.. state-wise if we know setModel will be called with the same model... we should just early return and skip the rest of this method? ish?",
