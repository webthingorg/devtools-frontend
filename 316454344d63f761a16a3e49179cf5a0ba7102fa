      "message": "Rather than setting an explicit color, can we instead set an attribute maybe? E.g. something along the lines of `fromElement.removeAttribute(\u0027has-focus\u0027)` and `toElement.setAttribute(\u0027has-focus\u0027)`. Then we can use the attribute selector in CSS and we don\u0027t have to handle the color.\n\nWe could maybe even use focus-within to do the styling: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:focus-within That would be the best outcome I think, but I am not 100% sure we properly set the focus on the relevant elements, since we maybe also keep the focus on the editor itself?",
