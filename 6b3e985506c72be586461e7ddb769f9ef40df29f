      "message": "As I noted on the bug, I do not think this is a complete fix.\n\n1. The issue also reproduces without snippets, all you need is a local file and \u0027network\u0027 file with the same URL. This fix only fixes the snippets sub-case, not the file case.\n\n2. I believe this fix would not work if the snippet gets loaded into several targets (e.g. main page and worker). For that case, we should still place breakpoints into both targets/source codes, but this CL only lets one target through. I have not tested this, though.",
