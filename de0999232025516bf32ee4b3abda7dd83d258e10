      "message": "Hey Sigurd,\nThere is a bug here. getIssueViewParent returns either a treeOutline or a treeElement, but IssueViews which inherits TreeElement can only have TreeElement|null as its parent. \nSo when we return this.issueTree which is a TreeOutline, the if statements passes and we end up reparenting in the same parent for issueViews that don\u0027t need to be reparented.\n\nWe can solve this by returning this.issueTree._parent (because this.issueTree.appendChild() is a wrapper around this.issueTree._parent.appendChild) but since this is private i didn\u0027t want to add any code to the legacy component without getting your opinion first.\n\ni have verified this using the debugger and lots of console.logs\n\nI\u0027m attaching a screenshot of the console.log \"console.log(issue.code(), issueView.parent, newParent);\" that I put inside the conditional: https://ibb.co/1d8Tm9s",
