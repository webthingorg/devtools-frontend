      "message": "Thinking about this a bit more, I\u0027m not sure this is the right fix here. Firstly, please could you point me to a flake on the bots? Or are you just seeing this locally?\n\nWe should try to understand exactly what part of the test is causing the timeout; is it that the button wasn\u0027t rendered to be clicked? Or that the click (for some reason) isn\u0027t firing? Or that there\u0027s a bug in the `withNoMutations` helper? Or a bug in the `waitForScroll` helper?\n\nBasically I\u0027d like to understand this test flake more (and see it, I\u0027ve not seen it fail once since I relanded it) rather than fix it with a 100ms timeout which will really just mask a problem in the test that may then appear in other tests too. If we understand it we can avoid causing it again.",

I have debugged the test, and the button is rendered, the selector for the button is returning the button correctly, the `dispatchEvent` method is returning success. I have tried to remove the `withNoMuations` and it didn\u0027t work, I also have tried to get the item button from inside the `withNoMuatation` and nothing is working. waitForScroll works perfectly, if I debug the test and I click manually the button, the test pass.\n\nAre you testing in windows or Linux?

      "message": "I\u0027m testing on a Mac personally but the bots that get run on CLs run the tests on Linux, Mac and Windows. To my knowledge the test hasn\u0027t flaked on the Chromium infrastructure which makes me wonder if there\u0027s something different about your build system (I\u0027m assuming it\u0027s an internal system so you can\u0027t point me to a flake?) that\u0027s causing it. I wonder if this is an Edge vs Chromium difference (although unlikely!) ? \n\nTo be clear, I\u0027m not adverse to landing a fix if it\u0027s causing flakes locally on Windows machines, but I\u0027d like to understand the exact problem to land a fix that can make all future tests robust (else we\u0027ll end up either having to repeat this CL N times for every test, or end up with seemingly random timeouts in our unit tests).",
