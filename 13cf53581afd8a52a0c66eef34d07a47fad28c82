      "message": "I think this is actually fine; what the code is doing now is seeing `Interfaces.Person` and deciding to hunt for `Interfaces` which it won\u0027t fine. We don\u0027t check `import * as ` imports because we don\u0027t support nested references. So although we won\u0027t provide such a good error I think it\u0027s an edge case that means we\u0027re OK to leave this test behind and land this CL.",
