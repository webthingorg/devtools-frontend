We (Meta) have been getting some feedback from developers recently that they\u0027d like to test their changes in Chrome for the Facebook in-app browser more easily.\n\nAs such, we thought it might be useful to add a user agent emulation preset that resembles a common device / app version using the Facebook in-app browser- adjusting for viewport size and user agent differences.\n\nMathias, would love your thoughts on this idea :) Thanks!",
