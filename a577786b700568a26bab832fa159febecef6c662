Do you have any suggestions for what specifically to say instead? Or do you have any other questions about what is happening here? I\u0027d be happy to explain in more detail if it doesn\u0027t make sense.\n\nPersonally, I don\u0027t think this is worth an article - I\u0027m hoping that a properly worded message will be enough.",

But I\u0027d expect the browser to know which headers it used for a request and which headers it got in the response - independently of wheather or not the request has actually been sent out or served from a cache. What could lead to those headers being changed at a later point in time?",
