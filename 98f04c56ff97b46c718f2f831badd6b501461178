I have removed the \"other origins\" collapsable tree section, but I\u0027m having one issue: I wasn\u0027t quite able to figure out how to add the link the chrome://serviceworker-internals page (I\u0027ve added a TODO comment in the code about that as well) so I would really appreciate some help for that.\n\nThank you!",
