      "message": "Hi Benedikt and Peter,\n\nI\u0027ve been trying to implement some of the UI changes for DevTools like we discussed. I have removed the \"other origins\" collapsable tree section, but I\u0027m having one issue: I wasn\u0027t quite able to figure out how to add the link the chrome://serviceworker-internals page (I\u0027ve added a TODO comment in the code about that as well) so I would really appreciate some help for that.\n\nThank you!",

      "message": "High-level LGTM from my side, I think we can also do the footnote link to the internals page in a follow up CL (especially since we should have a UMA counter as well that tells us how often developers click on that link, plus a baseline to which we can compare that number).\n\nPaul, Peter (Marshall), please take a look as well.\n\nPaul in particular: Can you provide guidance how to best do the internals page link?",
