      "message": "Hello, here\u0027s a small change to improve accessibility for links within this table.\n\nThe issue is mainly around preflight initiator links, since normal initiator links can already be accessed by opening the request details. However, it could be convenient to access the normal links directly from the table as well. If this is not preferable, the ArrowRight event could be scoped down to only apply to preflight initiator links. Ptal and let me know, thanks!",
