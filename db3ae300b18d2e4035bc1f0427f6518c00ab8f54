I don\u0027t know what the answer to that is at the moment. but i\u0027m leaning towards this just returning the \"raw\" values (as we might want them for the UI?). seems like the most straightforward step before adding opinionated advice part?\n\nThough if there have already been more thoughts around this i\u0027m open!",

IMO this is where we should \"interpret\" the values since this engine should be the source of truth for our insights.\n\nI\u0027m ok with this for now, but we should be cautious if interpreting the values gets too complicated. I can see these being pretty straightforward though.",
