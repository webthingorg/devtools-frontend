      "message": "Our thinking is this: Suppose there is a header named \u0027foo\u0027 with a value of \u0027bar\u0027 and the user edits the name to \u0027foo2\u0027. If this resulted in the creation of a header override \u0027foo2\u0027: \u0027bar\u0027 and the user reloaded, the server would still send the \u0027foo\u0027 header and DevTools would show both headers \u0027foo\u0027: \u0027bar\u0027 and \u0027foo2\u0027: \u0027bar\u0027.\nIf DevTools instead tried to be more clever and also removed the \u0027foo\u0027 header, how should this be shown to the user? Wouldn\u0027t this be even more confusing? How would the user be able to undo their changes?\nWe therefore chose to keep it simple and not allow header name changes. Users can easily achieve the same effect by removing the header and adding a header with the desired name.\n\nIn the case of adding a header, I don\u0027t think the same restriction makes sense (but I\u0027m open to be convinced otherwise). For freshly added headers this CL therefore allows editing the header name as well, but as soon as the user has reloaded the page, the header name cannot be edited anymore (with the exception of the remove and add workaround).",
