But at that point the PRESUBMIT should have failed (like it did for me when I tried to update it).\n\nI\u0027ve checked the changes and they look legit, so I\u0027ll try to find the CL that edited cmdevtools.css and managed to avoid updating the dark mode version.",

I fixed a bug in the script that meant it generated CSS that wasn\u0027t needed\n3. I didn\u0027t re-run the script.\n\nI should therefore update the PRESUBMIT to enforce that if the script itself has been modified more recently than the darkmode.css file, it should fail.\n\nhttps://crbug.com/1197060",
