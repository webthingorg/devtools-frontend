      "message": "There is a bug in our translation pipeline. The presubmit incorrectly handles these plural strings which we only recently started adding. If there is only a single word in curly braces, such as `{request}`, it is incorrectly interpreted as a variable and generates the error message you encountered.\nThis will be fixed eventually, but for now the suggestion was to append a zero-width space as a workaround. Could you please do that and remove the `@example...` syntax again?",
