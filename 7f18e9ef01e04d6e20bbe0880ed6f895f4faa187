      "message": "I think so too but I didn\u0027t understand its implications in here.\n\nThe issue is, color cicker is getting initial color values from a `Color`. Since we assign a value as `0` when they are powerless, the initial value we get in color picker is also `0`. Though the user is not defined this as `0`.[1]\n\nFor example, for `hue` the color `hwb(341deg 100% 0%)` says it is `0`. Then, when the color picker is opened, its `hue` slider sits at `0` and the input value shows as `0`. Since we show the authored text in the Styles pane, there is a conflict here: Styles pane says it is `341deg` but Color Picker says it is `0deg`.\n\nWDYT if we were to hold the values as how the user authored, do the conversions based on them and only when stringifying showing them `0`?\n\nI have a hunch that my suggestion might cause precision problems, i.e. after conversion `lch` hue is reported as `0.000002` instead of `0` and we\u0027ll need to handle that separately.\n\n[1]: https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:third_party/devtools-frontend/src/front_end/ui/legacy/components/color_picker/Spectrum.ts;l\u003d922?q\u003dfile:Spectrum.ts",

      "message": "I think this slightly changes the behavior:\n* Previously, AFAIU, we were returning originalText if `this.colorFormat \u003d\u003d\u003d color.format`[1]\n* Now, we return the generated string if the `colorFormat` exists in the Spectrum.\n\nSo, if we want to preserve the old behavior, we need to check\n`if (this.colorFormat \u003d\u003d\u003d color.format)` and return the original text.\n\nThough changing the old behavior might also be a reason, so was it intended? :)\n\n[1]: in `Color.ts`, it is `color.as(format)` and `colorConversions[format] \u003d () \u003d\u003e this` which comes back to the same color. If the original text exists there and the authored color was in gamut, we return the origianl text",
