      "message": "I think this slightly changes the behavior:\n* Previously, AFAIU, we were returning originalText if `this.colorFormat \u003d\u003d\u003d color.format`[1]\n* Now, we return the generated string if the `colorFormat` exists in the Spectrum.\n\nSo, if we want to preserve the old behavior, we need to check\n`if (this.colorFormat \u003d\u003d\u003d color.format)` and return the original text.\n\nThough changing the old behavior might also be a reason, so was it intended? :)\n\n[1]: in `Color.ts`, it is `color.as(format)` and `colorConversions[format] \u003d () \u003d\u003e this` which comes back to the same color. If the original text exists there and the authored color was in gamut, we return the origianl text",
