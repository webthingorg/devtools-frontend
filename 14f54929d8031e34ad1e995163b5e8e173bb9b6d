      "message": "thinking about it, I am not sure we should do this.\n\nI spoke with Andr√©s, who confirmed that the Timings track already has any extension events removed when we render it. \n\nSo if we get to this point in the code, what I think it might mean is that the user has done a `performance.measure` (or mark) that happens to have a `devtools` key in...and I think in that case we should probably show it rather than silently drop it.\n\n\nSo I would suggest we remove this check here. wdyt?",

After checking the impl better I think we don\u0027t need to do the check after all, since timings with valid extension data should not be rendered at all (we create different synthetic events for this).\n\nSorry for the misinformation!",
