# Chrome DevTools Design Review Guidelines

Please make sure to adhere to the following guidelines when applicable. There are multiple drivers for the formalization of the design process in Chromium DevTools:
1. Make it clear to the Individual Contributor (IC) who the decision makers are and highlight what the path forward is in the case where a project is not proceeding due to technical disagreement.
1. Create a forum to have straight-forward design discussions.
1. Ensure that the Technical Lead (TL) and the Engineering Manager (EnReOw) are aware of all significant changes and give them a chance to comment on designs early on.
1. Increase the involvement of all contributors all over the globe.

## Summary

**Important:**
1. Assume good intentions.
1. Be kind and civilized.
1. Be pragmatic.

The proposed workflow in here is based on the following assumptions and pillars:
1. Put the IC in charge. They are the ones who facilitate the process.
1. The technical leaders (TL, EnReOw) are tasked to help the ICs navigate the territory and find the right LGTM providers.
1. If a feature is uncontroversial, nearly no overhead should be created.
1. If there's a lot of controversy, the feature can be escalated to a dedicated design review meeting where future steps are decided.
