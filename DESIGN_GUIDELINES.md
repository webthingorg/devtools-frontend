Please make sure to adhere to the following guidelines when applicable. There are multiple drivers for the formalization of the design process in Chromium DevTools:

1. Ensure that the Technical Lead (TL) and the Engineering Manager (EnReOw) are aware of all significant changes and give them a chance to comment on designs early on.

## Summary

**Important:**
