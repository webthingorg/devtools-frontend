      "message": "Hi Alex, ptal at this attempt to add \"snapchanging\" to the list of event listener breakpoints under \"Control\". Given that the snapchanging feature is still only behind a Blink flag whose status is currently set to \"test\", can we go ahead with this change? I\u0027m not sure what the policy (if there is one) is. Thanks!",
